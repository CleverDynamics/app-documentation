If you install one of our apps from AppSource, Clever Config will automatically be installed as well. Retrieving License Details The first time you open one of the pages belonging to the app e.g. Clever Credit Setup or Clever Document Delivery Document Types, Clever Config will make a call to our licensing service with details of your installation to retrieve your license from our server. Trial Use of Apps If you do not currently have a license for that app one will be created to grant trial use of the app for 30 days. Details of the apps that are on your license are visible from the Clever Dynamics License Registration page. Search in the Tell Me box to open this page. This page shows the list of apps that your license entitles you to as well as: the license type (trial or license) the license count (see below) the expiry date of the license for each app the number of credits which have been consumed by each app since the last license refresh (see below) the number of remaining credits for each app License Count Most of our apps are covered by a single license for the entire tenant. Some apps, however, require a license per user e.g. Clever Credit is licensed by the number of credit controllers you have. Updating the License Clever Config will periodically make calls to the licensing service to check for updates. The date and time of the last request is displayed on the Clever Dynamics License Registration page. You can force a refresh of the license details by using the Activate License action at the top of the page. You may be asked to manually activate the license by our support team if they make changes to your license. License Credits Depending on type of license that you have, some apps will have a number of credits that you are entitled to. For example, queuing a document to be sent by Clever Document Delivery consumes 1 license credit. When a trial for Clever Document Delivery is activated you will be granted 50 credits. Once the trial has expired or all 50 credits have been consumed you will be unable to queue any more documents.

Enhancements On Before/ After Manual Release Events - Add events before/after manual release in the Credit Management codeunit to allow custom subscribers to override or extend the checks that are performed when an order is released. Allow a custom subscriber to have a custom definition of Overdue Credit TotalOverCreditLimit Or just override the entire function to decide whether a particular order should be credit held or not 2.2.19 Bug Fixes Creating an Interaction Hangs - When using \"Make Phone Call\" from the to-do list page. 2.2.18 Bug Fixes Handle licenses for trials and licenses the same i.e. the definition for AppIsLicensed() should be the same irrespective of the type of license. 2.2.17 Bug Fixes 2.2.16 has two fields: \"Company Registration No.\" \"Company Registration No. TMN\" We cannot publish this version to AppSource with a field without the TMN suffix.

Flowfield from Customer table? Field that is populated on validation of Bill-to Customer No?

Customer record cannot be deleted - Customer record cannot be deleted. The bug was fixed in credit management (objects), migrate the bug fix into the app. Reset customer contact no on business relation change - When business relation customer is changed, reset the original customer record and assign the contact no against new customer. 2.2.13 Enhancements Renumber into Clever Finance Range - Renumber into 9097029 - 9097128 Rework calling Customer Statement - MS are changing how the customer statement gets called. We need to copy in Clever Credit. Calculating Account Status When Calculating Ledger Entries - Use the routine that recalculates ledger entries to update the customer's account status. The only way that a customer should need to have their status updating without any other trigger (releasing an order, inserting a detailed CLE) is when a ledger entry moves from the not due ageing bucket to the first due ageing bucket. Recalculate Account Status When Grace Period Changes - Changing the grace period might change whether some invoices are considered overdue and therefore change the status of the customer account. Use Events OnBefore/OnAfter Manual Reopen/Release - Replace page action subscriptions with subscriptions to the OnBefore/OnAfter Manual Reopen/Release events which are now available in the sales release codeunit. Remove Service Password Permission - Remove Service Password permission in Clever Credit Setup table - it isn't required anymore and the Service Password table will be removed in a future version. 2.2.12 Enhancements Clever Credit Page Filters - Set the filter on the Credit Controller page according to the following logic: If the current user is the default credit controller then show customers with a matching or blank credit controller code If the current user is not the default credit controller, filter to customers with a matching credit controller code If no customer records fall within the filter, then remove change the filter to show customers with a blank credit controller code. Optionally Bypass Cust. Account Status Calculation - Especially for data migration scenarios. Otherwise the calls the CLE. Modify cause a calculation each time. Bug Fixes NA Build Failing - Reference to VAT Statements - Fix build for NA image - otherwise installation will fail for US and CA tenants. Installing App Fails When CLEs with No. Customer No. are Present - Prevent the app from attempting to retrieve the customer record in this case. The immediate problem is for the v1 app - presumably when the it is attempting to calculate customer stats when the CLE archived data is restored - but this could cause a problem for any version of the app. A CLE without a customer no. is valid e.g. when some data compression has been performed on the db. 2.2.11 Enhancements An option has been added to the My Notifications page to optionally disable credit held notifications on sales documents. Bug Fixes Fix to update the account status on the bill-to customer DD (Clever Document Delivery) integration using incorrect field. The actions Queue/Send email on the Clever Credit page, pass a RecRef of the current records to DD. Previously this page was based on the Customer record, since its source table is now the Credit Control Cust.

When an order is placed the system will do various checks based on your Clever Credit Setup options. How to Setup Credit Controllers These are users that have the permission to release documents from the Credit Held List . They also manage the chasing of debt from customers. Aging Bands Aging bands allow Credit Controllers to see how long overdue a customer\u2019s payment is. This helps manage and priorities the actions that need to be carried out. The older the overdue balance, the entries may appear in bolder or different colors on the Clever Credit list","title":"Clever How To Videos"},{"location":"Clever%20Credit/FAQ/","text":"Would having all the Credit \u2013 To \u2013 Do\u2019s in one list get confusing? Trying to find out who needs to chase what. No, individual credit controller dashboards help each of your team to keep on top of their specific accounts and outstanding balances. Follow up calls/to-dos are automatically diarised and visible in each team members dashboards to remind them when to chase promised payments. Can I set certain customers to be exempt from the credit rules? Yes, there is a Clever Credit FastTab on the customer card, which allows you to set different rules for individual customers. Can all users see the documents that are on Credit hold? There are many ways in which a user can see a document which is on credit held. The first place that it can be seen is on the Sales Document header itself. There is a field called Order Status , which indicates the state of the document. Another area in which users can go to find out which documents are on hold is through the Credit Held List. Doing this they will be able to see all Sales Documents being held. They can also navigate to the Credit Held List via the Manage Status button on the Sales document ribbon. Doing it this way will filter the credit held list to the sales document in which they have navigated from. Once a to-do has been completed how do I remove it? You don\u2019t need to deal with the manual task of completing to - do\u2019s once a process has been completed i.e. a cash receipt journal has been posted against a customer ledger entry in dispute the to do will disappear as the task has been completed and no further action is required. Doesn\u2019t holding the document slow the sales process down? At first it may seem that way, but over time with the right credit rules in place it will reduce the customers risk of late payments in the first place that would have put them on hold. We use deal with different currency and use exchange rates will clever credit work for us? Yes, but be aware of currency fluctuations. These will factor into how many times a document needs to be credit held. If a Sales Order is being Credit Held unexpectedly, particularly after it has already been Credit Released once, it may be related to a currency fluctuation. When releasing/shipping & invoicing an error pops up that the order needs to be credit held again, which is correct as the value has increased due to the exchange rate. Does your App integrate with other systems? Integration to Office365 and Skype for Business means actioning follow-up calls or emails to chase for payment are just a click away. Can a Sales document be held even after its been credit released? When a document is credit held it sits in the Credit Held list once released, the order moves to the Credit Released list and the sales headers status changes to credit released. From the Credit released list users can then highlight the document and click on the Hold button. This process means that you don\u2019t have to reopen or modify the sales document in any way to force it back through the credit held process. I am looking at the Clever To-Do\u2019s and can see a To-do for a customer that is not visible in the Clever Credit screen, how is this possible? This is most likely because the Clever Credit has been filtered to a specific credit controller. It could be that the customer is against a different credit controller. NB : Removing the filter from eth page won\u2019t clear the filter completely by default the screen will filter to the default credit controller if one has been set in the Clever Credit Setup page. The Clever Credit Statics box doesn\u2019t show a figure in the No. of To-Dos for a customer even though I know there is one from them. Only open To-Dos will show in here, if you click on the figure and clear the filter applied to the field Open the To-do(s) will most likely appear. One of my clients is going to be using Clever Credit, and their credit control office has a setup with a credit controller that runs the office, with several other credit controllers reporting to her. On the Clever Credit Page there is an Options button. If you click on that it gives you a couple of extra filters to the page. One of them includes the Credit Controller filter. The supervisor can filter the list to which ever credit controller customers they need to look at, and the list will be filtered based on which customers have been assigned to them. As well as assigning credit controllers to customers, she needs to be able to review the performance of the individual credit controllers, so in effect look at the \u2018clever credit\u2019 page as if she was another credit controller. How can this be achieved? You should note that when you log in (if you are credit controller) and have customers assigned to you the list will be automatically filtered on opening the page. If you are a credit controller and don\u2019t have any customers, then the list will show all customers. This means that if someone goes on leave then the list can be filtered so show their customers for someone else to manage. On the Clever Credit Screen, I have noticed that there are different colors and fonts against some of the balances. What do they mean? It is simply an indication of how far along the entries are in the ageing bands. The longer the overdue balance the bolder and brighter in red the colour gets.

Clever Credit has features designed to assist credit controllers in the chasing of debts and ensuring timely payment, as well as helping with the recording of promised payment dates and ensuring they are followed up on. Give your credit controllers monetary authorisation limits to enable sales orders to be released as required. The introduction of Clever To-Do\u2019s helps to prioritise your workload and chase promised payments which are automatically closed if the payment comes in.

The first option is to go through the setup manually. This consists of going into each of the setup pages (highlighted throughout the user guide) and creating the required business setup. The other option is to use the Assisted Setup(s) . Below we will explain the requirements for manually setting up the app, the first thing to do is to navigate to the Clever Credit Setup page. In the Clever Credit Setup page, you will notice a range of different options that can be selected as well as actions along the ribbon, these will be explained in more detail further on in the user guide. The Credit Hold boxes, in the General FastTab, control which document(s) should be held if a customer has an overdue balance. A tick against the field, Release Doc. On Credit Release , will mean that when a Credit Controller navigates through NAV to release the document from being Credit Held , it will also set the Status field (situated on the document header) to Released . This indicates to users and NAV that the document(s) can move through to the next stage of their process. Default Credit Controller The Default Credit Controller can be selected during this stage of the setup. This user will be able to release all credit held documents and will see customers on the credit control page that have not been assigned to another Credit Controller. NB : The Default Credit Controller is created based on the first person (within a Company), who accesses the Role Centre after the Clever Credit App has been installed. The flexibility within the app means that from this page you can create a different user to be the default Credit Controller, should you require. The selections made in the Clever Credit setup page are known as Global Settings .

Its\u2019 all about the Data: Accurate, complete Data with Clever Data Validation. Getting your master data correct, right from the start, is the secret ingredient to really making Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central work for your business. With Clever Data Validation you will have the ability to quickly specify templates for each master data entity (such as customer, vendors, items or resources) to prevent simple, avoidable errors in setting up master data in Dynamics 365 Business Central. The Clever Data Validation templates specify what data is mandatory for each entity. Then when new customers, suppliers, items and resources are added, Clever Data Validation highlights if any required data is missing or invalid. Going further it also allows you to: Highlight incorrect data combinations; for example, if an export customer is pointing to a domestic posting group Run the data templates(s) against a particular record or for all the records in a particular table \u2013 giving a list of errors with easy to understand messages so the user can resolve the issue Easily identify other records with data issues \u2013 every time you identify new missing or incorrect data. You can quickly define a new/updated data validation template, find all the other records with those issues and make sure they never occur again Ensure your users are confident that they have entered everything correctly, speeding up operations and massively improving user satisfaction Link the data validation to the workflow functionality of Dynamics 365 Business Central e.g. automatically validate a customer record when it is modified.

On the new Validation Template Card, create a code and complete a description, then choose the Table that holds the data to be validated, using the assist edit drop down list of all the tables. The field Validate Condition allows you to specifically filter the records that you want to validate, this will be explained further on in the user guide. The last two fields on the header of the data validation template are Block Record on Failed Valid and Blocked Value. Choosing to enable this option means that if a record within that template fails validation the record will not only be highlighted in the Data Validation Error List (detailed further on in the user guide), but the whole record is then blocked for processing purposes. This purposes come from the option selected in the field Blocked Value . If the enable the option Block Record on Failed Valid selected, you can then choose the Blocked Value. The options presented are options presented are the options that come from the table. NB : This option only works if the table allows the record to be blocked, for example an item can\u2019t be blocked for any reason, whereas a customer or vendor can be blocked. To create the actual rules, on the lines use the assist edit button to drop down the list of field numbers for the chosen table. Once a field number is chosen, the system will complete the field name, and we can then choose the Type for how we wish to validate the contents of that field. The types of rules that can be created are: Must Equal - the specified field must match the value that is entered in the Value column. Must match the filter - the specified field must have a value that falls within the filter specified in the Value column. The filter expression must match the type of data that is stored in the field specified. For example, use \\<>'' (different to blank) to indicate that the field must have a value; Use >0 to indicate that a numeric field must have a value greater than zero. Must be a certain length - the specified field must have a value that contains the number of characters set in the Value column. A user-friendly error message is then entered. In the examples below %1 means, it will use the field name in the error message. A translation of these error messages can be provided for use if you have other languages installed within Dynamics 365 Business Central. A condition can be applied to a template card so that it only applies to a certain subset of the records from that table, so in this case only to the customers in the EU, for example.

No, there is still a requirement for users to click a button, depending on which of the options are selected will depend on when the document is sent (based also on your setup). Even though I have changed some of the lines on the order the customer is still receiving an old copy of the order confirmation? This is because you on the document type the flag to Store Documents has been selected. You should not have this setup for the likes of documents which are constantly changing this should only be flagged if the document type is for a posted document, as these documents will never change. I\u2019m only seeing a limited amount of records on certain pages. On the setup page there is a field called Pstd.Doc. Posting Date Filter, by default this is set to 3M (3 Months). This is to stop the DD Record Selection page taking a long time to bring up all the records for you to select. I have some customers that need a GB Statement and others that need a EUR Statement can this be done? You can create as many document types against the same primary table as you like. The difference between having one document type and multiple ones is that once you have selected your records that you want to send the document out to, you must also choose the document types you want sending out. NB: when creating copies of the orginal document types make sure you give them meaningful code names, so you can identify which document types you are sending out. Can I set it up to send documents out as a batch in the evening rather than during working hours? When you choose to send a document, you can highlight a batch of them instead and click Queue Email . This option puts records into the Document Log as not processed. Your Job Queue Entry (DD specific one) will look at that document log and process at a given time any documents in the queue that have not been flagged as processed. Can I sign emails with the name of the user that submitted the email rather than the company name?

The attachment type is based on the attachment line you highlighted before pressing the action. Following on from general we then have the Report FastTab , most of the fields you will recognise. However, there are a few extra ones that you may want to use, such as; Custom Layout Code . This allows you to create a custom layout report which will then be sent put as part of that report\u2019s attachment, overriding the report you have populated in the Report ID field. In the filters section there are 2 fields relating to the report\u2019s filters. By default, the field Report Filter Source will be set to Primary Table . This means that based on the records you select it will filter the report using your selected records as they were selected from your primary table. For example, when running the Order confirmation, you are selecting records from the sales list. As the document types primary table is the Sales Header it means the report will be filtered based on you selecting the customers documents. You also choose the option Linked Tables ; you use this in a scenario where you have a report running from a linked table and you need those filters to run the report. As mentioned previously if your attachment is of type report all the above fields will be visible including a field called Optional. By default, this will be disabled . This action is used in circumstances where you are attaching a report to another report based on a set of requirements. For example, when sending a reminder to a customer you may also want to send the posted invoices related to that reminder. In most circumstances this will work as the payment is being applied to an invoice. On occasions where it isn\u2019t, and you are simply reminding the customer to pay an amount the document send will fail as no attachment could be created (there is nothing to create). Using the same scenario above but enabling the optional field no errors will occur. This means if there is something to attach so an invoice to send out with the reminder then it will do. If there is no invoice that can be generated, then it will be just the reminder that goes out to the customer. NB : You only flag the report that you want to be optionally sent.

If you select the option Protect Customer Password , you are choosing not to show the password given to each customer and vendor that chooses to protect the documents sent out. This simply masks the password indicating to your user that a password is there they just don\u2019t know what it is. The Printing FastTab , has one field called Print Handler , this field will be pre-populated based on which printing options you have setup and what your client allows you to use. The tab on the setup page, around Test Mode , gives you the chance to test sending out different documents through the app without them being sent directly to your customers whose documents you are testing on. Both the above features: Protect Customer Password and Test mode, will be detailed further on in the user guide.","title":"Default Configuration"},{"location":"Clever%20Document%20Delivery/User%20Guide/Document%20Delivery%20Setup/Password%20Protection/","text":"Another setup feature that you may want to take advantage of is Document Delivery Password .

This can then be hidden to users completely by using the setting mentioned in the Document Delivery Setup page; Protect Customer Password The use of a password is set on a Document Type basis and the Default Configuration adds the password feature to the Fields FastTab of each Document Type. This can be left on for some Document Types and removed for others, the users have full control. Also, the password can be removed from Customer Card page or Vendor Card page at any time to stop using passwords, without needing to change the setup.

On the General FastTab, you will notice straight away that the API Endpoint has been populated, this is supposed to be setup already for you. The API Key is something that you will need to populate, this will be given to you when you register with PrintNode Services. The API Description is simply some descriptive text relating to the setup. At this point you may choose to Test the connection, making sure that the API Key you populated is correct and that you can use the services provided. To do this select the button Test Connection on the Action tab. If successful, the following message will show. Once the General FastTab has been complete you can then move onto filling in the Test FastTab fields. Filling in the Printer Name and Printer Tray , allows you to then print a test page to those chosen credentials. To fill in the Printer Name field you can either type in the printer name if you know it or use the assist (three little dots) next to the field. This will display a list of all the printers you have available to you that you can select form. NB : There is no requirement for you to fill out the Test FastTab fields you can simply leave the fields blank.

It is within this screen that you will be able to attach the report you plan on sending out to that customer or vendor, later in the user guide we will talk about attaching attachments alongside or combined with reports. The Attachment Type at this stage should be set to Report . Once you have chosen your report you will notice both the Attachment Name and the Batch Attachment Name will automatically populate with text written in the Report Name field. These can be changed (not the report name field) but the attachment & batch attachment name fields. Changing these fields will change the description of the attachment sent out to your recipients. Like the above scenario the app queries whether to use the Subject or the Batch subject, it will also query when to use the Attachment Name (single records) or Batch Attachment Name (Grouped or queued records). The option to Store Documents should be used with caution and only really used on posted documents. Storing a document holds a record, at that point in time of how the document was, if you were to change that document and resend the amended version out again, the app will first look to the Stored Documents list, and if it finds a match it will resend the orginal document out again. In an ever-changing environment of sales order processing it would not work to Store the document records. Retention Period defines the period that the document should be kept in the Document Store for. The \u201cStore Until\u201d field on the Document Store table will be populated when the report is created. Each attachment can be set as a Watermark or Merge (added as additional pages to the back) or added as a separate attachment to the email. Attachments can be set to apply to only prints or only emails fro example only add the T&C\u2019s attachment when emailing, not printing. This is set in the field File Processing Type Against the attachments there are several actions which can alter an attachment and the way it is presented as part of that document type. New Line and Delete Line will either allow you to create a new attachment record against the document type or delete an attachment line you are no longer using. Doc. Type Attachment Card will open a detailed attachment card based on the attachment record you have highlighted to view. The Doc. Type Attachment Card will be explained further on in the user guide in more detail. Clicking on option Edit Request Page will open the reports request page, this is a set of filter options to run that report. For example, running the request page for Posted Sales Invoices you may what to filter out all invoices every time the document type is run (PSI) to not include Customers with location White. NB : If not done then the first time you process a record for a document type which hasn\u2019t had the request page flagged as run, then it will prompt you to set those options or filters as part of the process before it can send the document out. After the first time it will keep those settings and not ask again. If at any point you need to modify the request page the action Clear Request Page, will remove all report filters for that document type and unflag the attachment line as having no request page. Choosing the action Options allows you to set a calculation against any of the date fields on the attachments request page. NB: In order for the date fields to show on the Options page you must Edit Request Page first and this will populate the fields. This is mainly used on the Statement (STMNT) Document Type. You set the calculations against the fields StartDate and End Date so that every month when the statement is run it is running for the correct date criteria. NB: If the calculations weren\u2019t set in here, you would need to make sure that every month a user would need to go into this document type and change the request page. If they didn\u2019t the statements would be set out using the previous months date range. In order to automatically produce statements for the current month you can use the calculation formulas as shown below, this will return statements for the first to the last day of the current month.

The Subject relates to the subject of the email received by the recipient(s), this will be picked up when choosing individual records to send out. If multiple records have been selected and then grouped it will use the Batch Subject field as the subject of the email received by the recipient(s). It is only when the option Queue Email , (explained in more detail further on in the user guide) is used that the information in the Sender Name and Sender Address will be used. NB : The Batch Subject will also be used when choosing to Queue the emails rather than send them straight away. If you are using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, you must fill in the Sender Address regardless of whether you are using Send Email or Queue Email as the app no longer goes through Outlook. NB : Not populating it will cause an error visible in the Document Delivery Log. The other side of the FastTab relates to the printing of documents. Previously in the user guide we setup some Print Node fields allowing us to test whether we could print documents through Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. The settings in here allow you to determine if a document type should be printed or not. The Print field is a drop-down field allowing you to choose when and if you want the document type to print. Leaving the field Blank indicates that the document type does not need to be printed and only emailed to customers. If you choose When No Recipient , then you need to make sure you fill in the field Printer Name. By choosing when no recipient, you are telling the application that if an email address hasn\u2019t been found for a customer/vendor for a particular document type then print the document to a dedicated printer (indicated in the Printer name field). If you choose the final option Always , you are saying that regardless of whether there is an email to send the document type out to or not, you still want the document printing. This means in some cases only a printout of the document type will be done for all records selected. In other cases, both an email will be sent to the customer/vendor as well as printout being done. When populating the Printer Name field you ca either type in the printer name (if know) or use the assist next to the field to choose from the list of printers NB : Printer Tray is an optional field to populate you don\u2019t need to go to that level of detail unless you want your document printing from a certain printer tray in your printer.","title":"Delivery FastTab"},{"location":"Clever%20Document%20Delivery/User%20Guide/Document%20Types/Fields%20FastTab/","text":"The final FastTab on the Document type is the Fields FastTab. While some of the information on the document type may be static e.g. the sender address for the document type may not change for each document, much of the information will need to change with each record that is sent out. The Detail Type column tells the app that a document field holds data for a purpose. These are: To \u2013 the value of the field will be used as a to address of the email Cc \u2013 the value of the field will be used as a Cc address of the email Bcc \u2013 the value of the field will be used as a Bcc address of the email Attachment \u2013 the value of the field is the path to a file that should be included as an attachment on the email. The document type should include at least one document field with detail type of To . The other details types are optional. More than one document field can have the same detail type. The values of the fields will be combined when the email is created i.e. all To, Cc and Bcc recipients will appear on the email. In addition, all Attachment type fields will be included on the email. A document field will usually hold a single value (as per above) but it is possible to allow the document field to hold multiple values, simply by selecting the option Allow Multiple This functionality can be used to define multiple email recipients or multiple attachments on emails. The next field along is the No. of Lines field. Each document field has one or more Field Lines to define where the value of the field is taken from. Fields can take their value from: A field in the Primary Table i.e. the record that has been submitted to the document delivery system. A field in a Linked Table (see further on in the user guide), a field in a secondary table that is \u2018linked\u2019 to the primary table e.g. determining the To Address from the Customer record that is linked to a Sales Invoice Header record. A Static Value , some text that is entered directly into the Document Field Line. Each document field can have multiple document field lines i.e. multiple sources that the value of the field might come from. To get to these source click on the field. Above is an example of how the To Address of the Sales Order Document is evaluated: From top to bottom the lines are: The Value field from the DD Custom Value table (see further on in the User Guide) The First Name field from the Contact defined by the Sell-to Contact No. of the document The Name field from the Customer record If there is no corresponding DD Custom Value, or if its value is blank the system will take the First Name from the Contact table. If that field is blank e.g. because the Sell-to Contact No. is not defined on the document, then the Name field will be taken from the Customer record. Lastly, if that field is also blank the static text of \u2018Customer\u2019 will be taken. The final field on this FastTab is the Display Order. This is used to set a numbered order in which the fields are shown on the \u201cEdit \u2013 Report Selection\u201d page when sending a batch of records. If a negative number is set, then that field will not be displayed in the Values portion of the page, but its details will still be used. This is useful for forcing settings that can\u2019t be modified by the users.","title":"Fields FastTab"},{"location":"Clever%20Document%20Delivery/User%20Guide/Document%20Types/General%20FastTab/","text":"Each Document type is given a unique Code , this code can be found in multiple locations within Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. The code is also given a Description , so you know what type of document you are going to be running. The Primary Table No. Filter field tells the system which record(s) this document type should be used with. For example, a Sales Order Confirmation document type should use table 36 (Sales Order Header), while a remittance advice document type to be printed from the Payment Journal page should use table 81 (Gen. Journal Line). In addition, the Primary Table Document Type should be set when using table 36 (Sales Header) or 38 (Purchase Header). For example, sales quotes and sales order confirmations (both of which use table 36) it will allow you to choose a separate primary table document type. NB : If you try to set the Primary Table Document Type when you are not using table 36 or 38 then it will error. The Group by Field No . allows you to set a grouping at document type level, allowing you to highlight multiple records and for the app to determine based on your setup how the records should be sent out. For example, if you group by Sell-to Customer No . then all records highlighted to be sent will be grouped by this field. This means that your customers will not receive multiple emails for individual records, instead they will receive potentially one email with multiple records attached. When you click on the assist next to the field you are given all the fields that you can choose from to Group by, these are fields based on your Primary Table No. Filter The Group Field Name simply shows the name of the field you have chosen to group by.

The main thing to think about is the size of the database, as you store and link more documents in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central the more it will grow regarding achieving your documents. Its not recommend for businesses who plan on storing and retaining a lot of documents. Can you drag and drop directly from Outlook? The following 'free to use' add-in for Outlook enables you to drag direct from your Outlook inbox and creates a .msg file just as if you have gone via the desktop. Admittedly having to install a setup.exe client side is not perfect but then they are using client-side software with Outlook so that's an Office problem not a Dynamics problem. https://tonyfederer.github.io/OutlookFileDrag/ To use just download the 64bit version, run the setup.exe then restart outlook and it should ask you to authorise the drag and drop add-in. Do the documents always have to be stored in the Database? No, if you have another of our apps installed, Clever Document Links, you can set it to store your documents where you are storing your document links documents. On the Document Delivery setup page there is a field called Use Document Links Storage, if enabled it will save the documents there rather than the database.

See the technical specification here: https://www.ocrsdk.com/documentation/specifications/barcode-types/ Is there a limit to the file size that can be downloaded by Clever Document Links? As the files are downloaded from SharePoint using its web API, the file size is limited by the maximum web response size that AL clients are configured to handle (by default 15MB).

Another app of ours called Clever Config will be installed at the same time. NB: You should not Uninstall Clever config if you plan on using the Clever Documents Links App. Below we will explain the requirements for setting up the app and how importing the default configuration will save you time in getting the app ready for use. The first thing to do is navigate to the Document Links Setup Page. Once on the Document Links Setup page you will see the different options available to you. The first thing to do is click on the Actions tab on the ribbon and select the option Get Default Configuration. By running the Get Default Configuration action, a set of commonly used Document Types and the corresponding Search Fields are populated into your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central environment. Further on in the user guide you will find more information on Document Types and Search Fields. Other actions on the tab include Test SharePoint Connection , which is only available when you choose to store your document s in SharePoint and Update Archive Location. Each linked document within Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central has details of where it is stored individually. In cases where you would like to move the documents and need to update the file path location for document storage on the setup page you will need to run the Action Update Archive Location once you have manually moved all of the documents to the new location. This can be used in cases where you are moving from database to a network storage option, or moving to a different SharePoint Site/Folder. After running the Get Default Configuration action the next bit of setup you need to do is determine where you want to store your documents. If you drop down on the field File Storage you have two options. The Database option will store documents within your database. Clicking the SharePoint option in File Storage field will bring up a new FastTab called SharePoint Settings , to set up this service. You may want to run Test SharePoint Connection once the fields have been filled in using the button in the Actions ribbon, to make sure your connection is correct. The OCR Settings FastTab allows you to input an OCR Service User and Password. Populating these fields will enable Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central to read barcodes and find a record to match them within the database.

To add a document to attach to that record simply drag documents from a file location into the Drop Zone . If successful you will see a tick in the FactBox and your document will then be attached to the record. Alternatively, you can use the Upload option. You can import a variety of document types into a FactBox, such as .pdf, Microsoft Word documents and Excel documents. NB : Unlike the drag and drop function you will not see a document as being successfully uploaded, the only way you know if its uploaded is if it has attached itself to the record. Other options available include: Download - enabling you to download any documents within this FactBox by clicking the icon, which will open a pop-out window allowing you to open or save the document.

Once on the page start to create your attributes, simply click on the New button and begin by giving your attribute a unique Code along with a Name (something meaningful to describe the code you have just given your attribute).

Clicking on the Show Error action will show you the reason why the inbound document has a processing error against it. If multiple documents are coming through from the same trading partner you can consolidate them into one huge document, treating the inbound document as one Sales Document on creation rather than several smaller ones. If you do click on the Consolidate Documents action you must then decide which document you want the lines to be consolidated into. Once selected you will see how instead of two records on the screen there is only one record in the inbound documents screen containing the lines from both documents.

As mentioned before if a file has failed it will be flagged as having a processing error, remaining in the Inbound Documents screen waiting for an action to be carried out on it. Most processing errors tend to be around missing data, data which you can easily fix before reprocessing the document. If a file has failed, the first thing to do is view the processing error.

If the error is still present upon validating it will remain in the log, as still having a Processing Error . If it meets all the criteria the Inbound Document will not be flagged as having a processing error and ready to be accepted. Other actions on the page include being able to Accept or Reject the Inbound Document. By clicking on the Additional Data option, you can view other data that has been captured in the Inbound Document ( Additional Data ), or tracking information relating to lot or serial tracking ( Tracking ).

The Data Exchange definitions are used as a way of translating the file that comes into Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central from your trading partners. You can use the Search to get to the page or navigate from the Inbound Documents Types page. Once on the screen click on one of the documents types to see how the fields are mapped and the documents translated. Each Data Exchange definition has its own unique setup.

Below the General FastTab we then have the Line Definitions . The line definitions are split into two sections the Lines of the file (these are your order lines) and the Header of the file (this is general information about the order like shipping details and external document numbers).

To view how the fields are mapped you click on the Manage button and click the action Field Mappings. Based on whichever line you selected you will be presented with the field mappings. The field mappings determine which fields from the file will be mapped to which Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business central field.

It ranks in terms of priority so that records which have more \u2018hits\u2019 for the search term appear first. Once you\u2019ve found that data, we help you comply with GDPR by adding the capability to obfuscate that data, replacing it with a number series code. You can still satisfy your audit responsibilities, as we maintain one table which relates the number series code back to its original value. It\u2019s all completely customizable, you can control table by table, field by field what data you would like to be included, which means that your custom tables can quickly be included.

The first part of the user guide looks at how easy it is to setup your Clever Search criteria. The second part of this documentation will look at Obfuscating Data (masking data) based on the Clever Search results. To setup Clever Search, firstly navigate to the Clever Global Search Setup page, it is within here that you would create where Clever Search should be looking (tables & pages) when you type in your search criteria. As you start to create your Clever Search entry you will need to fill in the following fields: Table ID - Choose which table(s) you want clever search to be looking through when you start the search. NB : There is an assistance button next to the field Table ID to help the user know which table they are picking. Table Name - Selecting the Table ID will automatically populate the table name. Page ID - This field like the Table Name, will automatically populate based on the Table ID you have selected. Table Filter \u2013 Within this field you can set a filter on the search results for that table. For example, when you are presented with your search results you may not want an item included that fits your criteria because it is also blocked. You will have set the table filter to not show blocked items. Name Field No. \u2013 When you receive your search results there is a column called Name Field No., by populating this field you are choosing details from your table to populate this column with. For example, by selecting field 3 you are telling the App that when it presents you with the search results for that table, then you want that column being populated with the description of the item. The final piece of general setup is to choose which fields are included in your search of the table. As soon as you select your Table ID a list of fields will show at the bottom of the page, these fields relate to your Table ID. Simply go through the list and tick which fields you specifically would like global search to look at for your results. Once you have completed your setup a dialogue box will pop up on the screen asking you to Update the Index . You should say Yes to this option, the index should be rebuilt and updated every time a change is made to the Clever Search Setup. The status is also visible at the top of the page as Index Status , this status will change from Needs Updating to Up-To Date once the index has been rebuilt. Updating the Index will only happen if new fields have been added or removed from the setup. NB : If no changes are made you won\u2019t be prompted automatically on closing the setup page. However, from the process tab on the page you can run it manually. Other options also available on the tab include : Update Fields - which updates the fields available to the user to select during setup (these are fields only on the table that is setup to run the clever search on). Rebuild Index - which clears out all of the indexes built up previously and builds them up again with your setup. Obfuscation Setup - this will be explained further on within the user guide. NB : Rebuild Index is not something that is usually run but may need to be on the occasion that data bought in via Rapid Start has not been validated correctly.","title":"Clever Search Setup"},{"location":"Clever%20Global%20Search/User%20Guide/03.%20Global%20Search/","text":"Once setup, Clever Search can be run from several different pages within Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, it can be run through the Clever Global Search page or from the Items, Customers or Vendors List pages.

This number represents how many hits within the \u2018search for\u2019 string that Global Search has found and then gets populated based on this number. For example, if you search Green Chair and the description of an item had both words Green and Chair in it, then the Hits field would be populated with 2 rather than 1. If you are running it from one of the pages mentioned above (Items, Customer, Vendors). Firstly, navigate to the page in which you want to run the search on. Click on the actions tab and then choose the Clever Global Search option. The Clever Global Search Filter screen should then appear where you can then fill in your search terms. You are also able to choose the option to match all of the terms within your search criteria to give you better precision within your results or just some of the terms (disabling it) which will provide you with a wider range of results for the search criteria that you have input.

Enter a new line per code, adding the required information for the calculation type and the posting accounts for each Landed cost. The first field to populate is the Landed cost type code ; a code is created for each landed cost type. A landed cost type can be created for each freight provider. Landed cost types are then assigned to items. The description field is a way for you to identify each code you have created. It also helps in understanding what each code means. The next field along is the Calculation Type ; Defines whether the expected cost is calculated based on the duty %, or the weight or volume of the item based on the item card fields. Options are Duty, Weight (KG), Volume (M3). These options can be selected by using the drop down arrow next to the field.

For this combination of Gen. Bus. Posting Group and Gen. Prod. Posting Group you should also set the Overhead Applied account to the same as the Inventory Accrual Acc (Interim). This ensure the landed costs are posted correctly within the general ledger. Like the accrual account you need a Variance Account for each code where there is a difference between the expected cost (recorded on receipt) and actual cost on invoicing the variance is posted to this account.

Exit Codes On the odd occasion an operator may need to exit their current production order for reasons other than the machine being stopped. For example, if a production order was to come to the Production Floor that had a much sooner shipping date than the order they are currently working on they may need to focus their attention on this. MES Exit Codes are optional and do not need to be entered if not necessary. Stop Codes During your production process there may be times when you need to identify why a machine is not running and whether this is a planned stop or unplanned. To do this you create Stop Codes. Switching Between Devices When activated Allow Device Switching allows you to change the Machine Center that the Output Screen looks at. This can be particularly helpful if the devices loaded on MES are not going to be in one location and are needed for multiple machines. Uploading and Viewing Instructions On the Device you may need to see certain instructions to action the production line for example a spec on how to build the item. To see these instructions, they must be applied to the routing lines. Creating Notes Adding Notes within Clever MES can be helpful. If something has happened during the Production Process the operator can use the Notes action on the device to attach their notes against the operation they are working on.

Page Customisation Most of the logic for defining the pages that are displayed in the web portal by MES is contained in the MES \u2013 Page Definition Mgt.\u201d codeunit. This codeunit builds populates data in the following temporary tables: Portal Framework Control - each record defines a control (button, grid, textbox, image etc.) that should be displayed on the page. Portal Framework Control Data \u2013 data that is associated with a control e.g. the data to be shown in cells of a grid control. Portal Framework Control Metadata \u2013 the metadata associated with a control, e.g. its type, colour, caption The standard MES logic will populate these tables with records to define each page in the portal. The following integration events provided opportunity to override the standard logic. OnBeforeBuildPage \u2013 called before any of the standard logic is applied OnAfterBuildPage \u2013 called after the standard logic has been applied OnAddControlToPage \u2013 called immediately before each control is \u2018added\u2019 to the page i.e. before each record is included in the set. These events can be used to manipulate the data contained in these temporary tables, which in turn will reflect the controls that are built by the portal. OnBeforeBuildPage This event is called before any of the standard logic for defining the page is called. The following parameters are included: ActivityCode \u2013 a code that denotes the type of activity for which a page needs building e.g. DataSelection, OutputScreen, ComponentSubform \u2013 see the xyzCode functions in the \u201cMES \u2013 Activity Mgt.\u201d codeunit. PortalFwkApplicationDevice2 \u2013 a record denoting the current Portal Framework Application device. DataTypeCode \u2013 when the requested activity is - DataSelection, this code indicates the type of data that should be presented to the user for selection. PortalFrameworkControl \u2013 the temporary table representing the set of controls PortalFrameworkControlData \u2013 the temporary table containing data associated with the controls PortalFwkControlMetadata \u2013 the temporary table containing metadata associated with the controls. ActivityLogEntryNo \u2013 the entry no. of the log record associated with this activity. Handled \u2013 a Boolean indicating whether the event has been handled (true indicates that the standard logic should not be called). OnAfterBuildPage This event is called after the standard MES logic has been applied. The same parameters are included as for OnBeforeBuildPage, except for the Handled parameter: ActivityCode \u2013 a code that denotes the type of activity for which a page needs building e.g. DataSelection, OutputScreen, ComponentSubform \u2013 see the xyzCode functions in the \u201cMES \u2013 Activity Mgt.\u201d codeunit. PortalFwkApplicationDevice2 \u2013 a record denoting the current Portal Framework Application device. DataTypeCode \u2013 when the requested activity is DataSelection, this code indicates the type of data that should be presented to the user for selection. PortalFrameworkControl \u2013 the temporary table representing the set of controls PortalFrameworkControlData \u2013 the temporary table containing data associated with the controls PortalFwkControlMetadata \u2013 the temporary table containing metadata associated with the controls. ActivityLogEntryNo \u2013 the entry no. of the log record associated with this activity. OnAddControlToPage This event is called for each control that is included in the temporary tables that is set by the standard logic. This gives the opportunity for the data associated with the control to be manipulated, the control \u201cskipped\u201d i.e. not included on the page and new controls to be injected before the current control. The following parameters are included: ActivityCode \u2013 a code that denotes the type of activity for which a page needs building e.g. DataSelection, OutputScreen, ComponentSubform \u2013 see the xyzCode functions in the \u201cMES \u2013 Activity Mgt.\u201d codeunit. PortalFwkApplicationDevice2 \u2013 a record denoting the current Portal Framework Application device. PortalFrameworkControl \u2013 the temporary table representing the set of controls PortalFrameworkControlData \u2013 the temporary table containing data associated with the controls PortalFwkControlMetadata \u2013 the temporary table containing metadata associated with the controls. SkipControl \u2013 a Boolean indicating whether the control should be skipped. If this is set to true the current control will not be included on the page that is built by the portal. Adding Controls New controls can be added though use of the functions on the PortalFrameworkControl parameter passed by the above integration events. The following functions can be used to create new controls: AddNewEntry \u2013 creates a new control below the current one and moves the pointer to the new control. AddNewEntryBefore \u2013 creates a new control before the current one and moves the pointer to the new control. These functions require a ControlID. This should be a unique code that is associated with the control. This ID will be used in subsequent web service calls to NAV when activity occurs that is associated with this control. See Handling Device Activity. Metadata Having creating the control, metadata must be added to determine its type and appearance. Metadata records are added with the AddMetadata function. The following parameters are required: PortalFwkControlMetadata \u2013 a Portal Framework Control Metadata record. This will be populated with the appropriate values defined by the other parameters and inserted. Name \u2013 the name of the metadata. See Metadata Names and Values for a list of valid metadata names and values. Type \u2013 the type of the metadata. This is an option: 0 = Element, 1 = Attribute. The correct value for this parameter will be determined by the metadata name. Value \u2013 the value of the metadata. See Metadata Names and Values for a list of valid metadata names and values. If you use these functions to create a new control you will need to implement an event subscriber to handle the activity associated with the control. For example, if you add a new button control you need to provide a handler function for to determine the correct response to that button being clicked. Metadata Names and Values Below is a list of the valid metadata names and their corresponding values. Name Type Value type 0 button, text, selectiontiles, selectionlist, image caption 0 The text of the caption value 0 The value to display in the control colour 1 Any value that is valid for HTML i.e. hex value, name of colour placement 1 'right'/'left' subform 1 true/false layout 1 'nav'/'1-column'/'2-columns' Handling Device Activity \u2018Activity\u2019 refers to anything that happens in the web portal which results in a call to the NAV web service. The context of the activity (the control that was used, the current state of the page) is passed to NAV and the portal expects a response containing the definition of the page that should be shown next. You can use the following integration events in the \u201cMES \u2013 Post Mgt.\u201d codeunit to execute your code when \u2018activity\u2019 takes place on the portal. OnBeforeHandleActivity This event is called before any standard logic is executed. You can use this event to override the response to standard MES activity or define the response to your own controls. The event has the following parameters: PortalFrameworkControl \u2013 the temporary table containing the controls on the page PortalFrameworkControlData \u2013 the temporary table containing the data associated with the controls on the page PortalFwkApplicationDevice \u2013 a record indicating the device that the activity came from ActivityCode \u2013 a code denoting the type of activity that has occurred i.e. the code corresponding to the portal page that the activity took place in. Command \u2013 a code denoting the control on the above page that raised the activity. This code corresponds to the ControlID assigned to the control by the Page Definition codeunit. See Adding Controls. PortalFrameworkActivityLog \u2013 the activity log record associated with this activity Handled \u2013 a Boolean indicating whether this activity has been handled. A value of true will bypass any standard logic that would apply to this activity. OnAfterDeviceActivity This event is raised after any standard logic has been applied in response to the activity. It has the same parameter as OnBeforeDeviceActivity except for the Handled parameter, which is omitted. PortalFrameworkControl \u2013 the temporary table containing the controls on the page PortalFrameworkControlData \u2013 the temporary table containing the data associated with the controls on the page PortalFwkApplicationDevice \u2013 a record indicating the device that the activity came from ActivityCode \u2013 a code denoting the type of activity that has occurred i.e. the code corresponding to the portal page that the activity took place in. Command \u2013 a code denoting the control on the above page that raised the activity. This code corresponds to the ControlID assigned to the control by the Page Definition codeunit. See Adding Controls. PortalFrameworkActivityLog \u2013 the activity log record associated with this activity Production Groups MES can be customised with the concept of \u201cProduction Groups\u201d. This provides a way of grouping prod. order lines that need to be worked on together other than by the prod. order no. The user will be presented with a list of production groups to select from, rather than a list of prod. orders / prod. order routing lines. Setup MES can be configured to use production groups globally i.e. all machine centres are assigned work by production groups, by including the PROD_GROUP data type in one of the three data selection fields on the MES Setup page. Alternatively, if some machine centres work with production groups, but not all, the \u201cUse Production Groups\u201d field can be set on the MES tab of the Machine Centre card. Note : in the Process Type must be set to All Lines (rather than Single Lines) for Machine Centres that use production groups. Implementation The standard MES product has no definition of what a production group is, or the lines that it contains. This definition must be supplied by event subscriptions in custom code in the project. Two key pieces of information are required by MES at various points during the workflow: What are the valid production groups that the user can select from? Which prod. order routing line(s) are included in each production group? These questions are answered by subscribing to the following events: COD9059236. OnBuildProdGroupSelectionBuffer This event is used to define the valid production group(s) that the user can select. This event should be subscribed to in a custom codeunit. The parameters to the function are as follows: PortalFwkApplicationDevice \u2013 the record corresponding to the device that has made the call to the Portal Framework Web Service. This can be used to determine extra information about the call e.g. the Machine Centre or Operators that have been selected. PortalFrameworkControl \u2013 the selection list representing the list of production groups that will be presented to the user. This record should be populated with the appropriate row/column data to show to the user. PortalFrameworkControlData \u2013 this record represents the collection of row/column data that has been populated from the production groups. Handled \u2013 a Boolean that should be set to true to indicate that this event has been handled. Example: In this example a bespoke field has been added to the Prod. Order Line table to indicate which production group each line belongs to. This code loops through the prod. order lines to determine the distinct set of production groups related to the Machine Centre that the user has already selected. Note : the first row of data added to PortalFrameworkControl will be used as the headings for the selection list that is presented to the user. MESManagement.GetDeviceMachineCenter(PortalFwkApplicationDevice,MachineCenter); PortalFrameworkControl.AddData(PortalFrameworkControlData,1,1,'Code',FALSE); PortalFrameworkControl.AddData(PortalFrameworkControlData,1,2,'Description',FALSE); RowNo := 1; ProdOrderLine.SetCurrentKey(\"Production Group Code\"); ProdOrderLine.SetFilter(\"Production Group Code\",'>%1',''); if ProdOrderLine.FindSet() then repeat ProdOrderRoutingLine.SetRange(Status,ProdOrderLine.Status); ProdOrderRoutingLine.SetRange(\"Prod.

Available to Start (Base)\",'>%1',0); IF NOT ProdOrderRoutingLine.IsEmpty() THEN BEGIN ProdOrderLine.SetRange(\"Production Group Code\",ProdOrderLine.\"Production Group Code\"); RowNo += 1; PortalFrameworkControl.AddData(PortalFrameworkControlData,RowNo,1,ProdOrderLine.\"Production Group Code\",false); PortalFrameworkControl.AddData(PortalFrameworkControlData,RowNo,2,ProdOrderLine.\"Production Group Code\",false); ProdOrderLine.FindLast; ProdOrderLine.SetRange(\"Production Group Code\"); END; UNTIL ProdOrderLine.NEXT = 0; Handled := TRUE; COD9059236.OnMarkProdOrderRtngLineForProdGroup This event allows a custom subscriber to mark the prod. order routing lines that are related to a given production group. It will be called several times as the user navigates around the MES portal to display details appropriate to the selected production group. The event has the following parameters: PortalFwkApplicationDevice - the record corresponding to the device that has made the call to the Portal Framework Web Service. This can be used to determine extra information about the call e.g. the Machine Centre or Operators that have been selected. ProdGroup \u2013 the production group which has been selected. ProdOrderRoutingLine \u2013 a record where the lines related to the production group should be MARKed. Handled \u2013 a Boolean to indicate that this event has been handled. Example: As above, a bespoke field has been added to the prod. order line to indicate which production group they belong to. The prod. order lines belonging to the production group are iterated through and those lines which have a prod. order routing line for the current Machine Centre, with a quantity available to start, are MARKed. MESManagement.GetDeviceMachineCenter(PortalFwkApplicationDevice,MachineCenter); ProdOrderLine.SetRange(\"Production Group Code\",ProdGroup); if ProdOrderLine.FindSet() then repeat ProdOrderRoutingLine.SetRange(Status,ProdOrderLine.Status); ProdOrderRoutingLine.SetRange(\"Prod. Order No.\",ProdOrderLine.\"Prod. Order No.\"); ProdOrderRoutingLine.SetRange(\"Routing Reference No.\",ProdOrderLine.\"Routing Reference No.\"); ProdOrderRoutingLine.SetRange(\"Routing No.\",ProdOrderLine.\"Routing No.\"); ProdOrderRoutingLine.SetRange(Type,ProdOrderRoutingLine.Type::\"Machine Center\"); ProdOrderRoutingLine.SetRange(\"No.\",MachineCenter.\"No.\"); ProdOrderRoutingLine.SetFilter(\"Qty. Available to Start (Base)\",'>%1',0); if ProdOrderRoutingLine.FindSet() then repeat ProdOrderRoutingLine.Mark := true; until ProdOrderRoutingLine.Next() = 0; until ProdOrderLine.Next() = 0; Handled := true; Instructions MES includes the ability to display PDF instruction sheets to users related to the operation that they are working on. The standard application allows the user to upload a PDF document against a Routing Line record. When this routing line record is inherited by a released production order the user will see an \u201cInstruction\u201d button in the navigation pane in the MES portal. Clicking this button will display the PDF content in the portal window. This functionality can be overridden by subscribing to the follow events: ### COD9059234.OnBeforeProdOrderRtngLineHasInstruction This event allows a custom subscriber to indicate if the prod. order routing line has an instruction. This is used to determine whether to display the \u201cInstruction\u201d button on the output screen. The event has the following parameters: - ProdOrderRtngLine - This might be a set of record if the machine center is an All Line process type - HasInstruction \u2013 set the Boolean if there is an instruction available - Handled \u2013 a Boolean to indicate that this event has been handled. COD9059234.OnBeforeGetProdOrderRtngLineResource This event can be used to set the resource that will be displayed on the instruction page. The event has the following parameters: - ProdOrderRtngLine \u2013 single record in question for resource - ResourceValue \u2013 resource identifier path, should be unique for each file. - i.e. the value consist of an identifier directory and a file name with the primary keys of the record which the resource is set against. - ResourceFileExtension \u2013 the file extension of resource file - Handled \u2013 a Boolean to indicate that this event has been handled. Example: Setting the resource from a sales order after getting the sales header of the ProdOrderRtngLine ResourceValue := StrSubstNo('%1/%2_%3',SalesOrderInstructionDirectoryName,SalesHeader.\"Document Type\",SalesHeader.\"No.\"); ResourceFileExtension := 'pdf'; Handled := true; *SalesOrderInstructionDirectoryName is a function that returns \u2018/MES/SalesOrder/Instruction\u2019 COD9059234.OnBuildPortalResourceResponse This event can be used to return the resource file content. The resource file is cached on retrieve so the file content is only required if the file has been updated since last response. The event has the following parameters: - ResourceDirectoryName \u2013 the resource identifier directory - ResourceValue \u2013 resource file name - LastRetrieved \u2013 the downloaded DateTime - PortalFrameworkControl - record to add resource control - PortalFwkControlMetadata - record to add resource control metadata - Handled \u2013 a Boolean to indicate that this event has been handled. Example: case ResourceDirectoryName of SalesOrderInstructionDirectoryName: begin PortalFwkApplicationDevice.SplitData(ResourceValue,ResourceKeyArray,'_'); SalesHeader.SetFilter(\"Document Type\",ResourceKeyArray.GetValue(0)); SalesHeader.SetRange(\"No.\",ResourceKeyArray.GetValue(1)); SalesHeader.FindFirst(); GetSalesOrderResource(SalesHeader,LastRetrieved,TempBlob,LastUpdatedDateTime); MESSetup.Get(); PortalFrameworkControl.AddNewEntry(MESSetup.\"Portal Fwk. Application ID\",ResourceTxt); PortalFrameworkControl.AddMetadata(PortalFwkControlMetadata,'modifiedOn',0,FORMAT(LastUpdatedDateTime,0,'')); PortalFrameworkControl.AddMetadata(PortalFwkControlMetadata,'mimeType',0,MESPageDefinitionMgt.GetMimeType('pdf')); if (LastRetrieved = 0DT) OR (RoundDateTime(LastUpdatedDateTime,1000,'\\<') > LastRetrieved) then PortalFrameworkControl.AddMetadataBlob(PortalFwkControlMetadata,'content',0,MESPageDefinitionMgt.BlobToBase64String(TempBlob)); Handled := true; end; end; *PortalFwkApplicationDevice: Record 9059291 *MESPageDefinitionMgt: Codeunit 9059234 *GetSalesOrderResource is function which will return the resource content in TempBlob if the file has been updated since the last download.

MES operators can be setup two different ways, , the first to post their time and cost against a given machine centre the second is simply to provide a list of operators where no costs will be posted to for them and only applied to the capacity ledger entries (and device logs) to say this operator worked on this machine centre. To do this you first need to navigate to the MES Operators Page, do this by using the Search function. Once on the page, you will need to start populating the necessary fields. The Code is a unique identifier for each operator created. The Name is the operators name. The name shown here will be visible on the device during the production process. The next field is optional by linking an operator to a machine centre is to allow for costs and time to be posted against the routing line as well as the machines cost and time (the one they selected on the device). Creating separate ledger entries. If you do decide to populate the Machine Centre No field, you need to make sure that in your MES Setup page that Post Operator Time/Cost is enabled. NB : Ticking this option requires an operator to be linked to a machine centre, if for any reason it is missed otherwise it will error in the device when trying to post capacity ledger entries. You typically create the operator as a new machine centre, to do this click on the New option instead of selecting a machine centre already there. By clicking on the New option, it will open up a blank Machine Centre Card , which you will need to fill in. Make sure to especially populate the Unit Cost field, this is to determine the cost of the machine once the production line has been completed. You will notice there is an MES FastTab on the page. This will be detailed later on in the User Guide, however at this point you do need to go into that FastTab and make sure Show in MES is not enabled. This is to make sure you don\u2019t see this Machine Centre on the device. The next field along is the Unit of Measure Code is the unit of measure that will appear against the capacity ledger entry is also used in the calculations of the costs operator if you choose to Post Operator Time/Costs. The final field is the Unit Cost . This is the Unit cost of the operator. Access Codes With the operators now, setup there are a couple of other options you can apply to the operators the first is giving them an Access Code .

On the FastTab there are several fields which you can enabled and change depending on how you would like that Machine to work. You can choose to change the setting Prod Order Presentation. During the initial setup of the device, to begin the output process the user will be presented with a list of routing lines, which in turn identifies the production orders those routing lines belong to. By default, this field is set to Prompt (per machine centre) which means the operator will be presented with a list of routing lines, through production orders which need to be completed. If you change the machine centre to be Automatic , then the operator will simply be presented with the next routing line not completed for the next production order in the list, not giving them the option to choose specifically which Production Order (routing line) they are going to be working on. Like the previous field the Process Type can be changed from the default Single Line to All Lines when an operator wants to work on multiple routing lines for the same operation within one production order . For example, several items might be loaded into an oven and be worked on simultaneously. In this scenario, the SFDC operator doesn't want to have to select each prod. order line in isolation or start and stop the machine. This option can only be ticked when the Machine Centre is set to process Multiple Lines. When this option is ticked the Components, subpage will appear slightly differently. Retrieve the components for all of the prod. order lines that are being worked on but only show each unique item/variant code once. Total the expected quantity (base) from all lines. When the components are posted, instead of posting item journal lines as usual, the consumption should be recorded in the above table. Split \u2013 Post Consolidate Components - Option to split and post the entries currently being stored in the SFDC Consumptions Entry table. The Qty. to Post on a \"Consolidate Components\" screen should be split proportional between the prod. order lines. Show in SFDC Only show machine centres where this is ticked in SFDC. Confirm Operator on Output - Present the user with a Subform of tiles of the operators currently assigned to the prod. order routing line. Ask them to select the (one) operator who has worked on the output. Show Prod Order from Work Ctr- by setting this to an option other than Default it will overwrite whether you have this option switched on or not per machine centre. The final setting is Use Production Groups , this can be a global setting done in SFDC or at machine Centre level. The idea behind Production groups is that an operator may want to work on multiple routing lines from multiple production orders on one machine centre.

MES Activity Log The MES Activity Log shows all Activity undertaken by Operators at a high-level, meaning that for example whilst it will show that a user has selected the Components screen it will not show the item number nor the quantity of the component that has been output. What the Activity Log is useful for is looking at error messages and how long operators are spending within each screen. Below is a breakdown of each field in the MES Activity Log: Entry Number \u2013 The number of the entry of the activity created. Device ID \u2013 Which device was being used by the operator that created the entry. Activity Code \u2013 Which screen or SubForm the operator was in at the time of the activity. Command \u2013 The activity performed within the screen or SubForm by the operator. Data Type Code \u2013 Will show the Data Types that were selected by the operator when logging into SFDC. Activity Date/Time \u2013 The time and date at which the action was performed. Error/Error Message \u2013 This will show if the operator came across an error during the Production Order, this may be due to NAV setup for if the Operator has made a mistake. The Error message field will also show when Production Orders are completed, these will not have a tick within the Error field. Next Activity \u2013 This will show the next action performed by the Operator. MES Device Log The MES Device Log differs from the MES Activity Log in that it only shows the Stops and Starts of Devices and the reasons for this. It does give a much more in-depth overview of this than the Activity Log including showing the Reason Codes selected by the Operators.

Device ID \u2013 Which device was being used by the operator that created the entry. Production Order No. \u2013 Relates to the Production Order being completed at the time. Production Line No. \u2013 The Item Number being created by the Production Order. Operation No. \u2013 The number of the operation being undertaken as part of the production order. Operator No \u2013 Code of Operator completing the Production Order. Entry Type \u2013 States whether the device was stopped or started or if the production order was exited. Stop Status \u2013 Will show if the Stop was Planned or Not. Entry Date/Time \u2013 The time and date at which the action was performed. Reason Code - This will be the initial reason that the operator selected when stopped the machine. Actual Code \u2013 This will show if the reason changed, if for example \u2018Under Investigation\u2019 was selected initially, this may change to \u2018Power Cut\u2019 on the second prompt. Exit Code \u2013 This will show an entry if the operator chooses to completely exit the Production Order. Duration (seconds) \u2013 This is how long the device was left in this state. Operator Cost \u2013 If the Operator has been setup with an associated cost, this will be calculated in this field.

Like previous tabs in MES setup there are a range of options, that you can select, making the application more suited to your business requirements. The Allow Scrap tick box determines whether to display the Scrap button in the application (device) screen. Within the device it means that users can see the button and then then determine how much of the routing line they would like to scrap. On the device screens once enabled operators will be able to select the scrap option. NB : Posting the scrap does not adjust the Quantity Remaining to output on the routing line, scarp is a separate posting. Instead once you click OK on the scrap screen it will post a Capacity Ledger Entry against the production order updating the field Scrap Quantity on the line . If you are planning on using scrap, make sure to setup Scrap Codes this is a standard manufacturing component of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Premium and can be found using the search. The scrap code selected by the operator during the scrap process can be seen in the MES Device Log, which we will detail later in the user guide. NB : The Default Configuration will import some Scrap codes; however, you may want to go into that page and add your own business specific ones. If you enable the flag to Allow by Products , indicates that you might not want to scrap a component but instead create a by-product of it, selecting this option shows the button on the device in the navigation pane (just like scrap). Once visible you then need to setup which items will be the By Product of your finished item. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central go to the search for MES By-Products to set these up. Use the assist button to setup your finished item Filter. Further on in the user guide MES By- Products will be explained in more detail and how they flow through to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. Select the option Allow Device Switching to indicate that the Device is not tied to one machine, giving flexibility where required or unexpected circumstances for the device to be switched to another Machine Centre by the operator. Choosing to Post Output During Setup Time will determines whether the operator can post output during setup time (this can be found on the routing line). Flagging this option shows it is relevant to your business process, but not a requirement should your business want to stop operators from doing that. Within the Output Screen tab, we then have a sub- section of options around Item Tracking, Lot Track Output, Lot Track Consumption & Component Lot Handling : The Lot Track Output , when ticked, identifies if there is an item tracking line for the production order line, if there is this will be displayed on the output screen. The Lot Track Consumption tick box is used to determine the lot number for a component. Component Lot Handling \u2013 should only be setup if Lot Track Consumption is selected. If selected choose from one of the 3 options below: Blank Option- will work as per the existing functionality i.e. showing a Lot No. column for the user to populate with the appropriate lot manually. Populate when Single Lot Option - indicates that the system should automatically populate the Lot No. column for a component line when there is a single item tracking line already existing against the Prod. order component. Split by Lot Option - If there are already some item tracking lines against a prod. order component it should be possible to split the component lines shown on the portal by each combination of component line no. and lot no.

Device data works in several ways. It gives the users opportunities to set defaults for when they are running the interface on their devices. Users can choose to set up the data to be Blank, Session or Permanent in the Retain Data field . Blank Means that it will take the defaults that you have set in the data fields as the options you are picking when running the MES Portal.

This newly chosen option of Centre will then push back to the settings in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. Session Means the data is retained for the device session. For example, once a production is completed on the portal the blank data types are reset and subsequently the operator will be prompted to make selections, retaining just the session and any permanent data . Permanent This means that the data populated against each of the Data Type codes will always be the same. It means that that if the user were to click the back button in the MES portal it won\u2019t allow them to select a new Centre for example it will keep them in the same centre that has been set Permanently in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

Once you have created the promotion item group you can click on Process > Add items to add the relevant items into the Promotion Item Group, in this case I will filter by the item category code: This has added all the items within this item category to the Promotion Item Group: As you only want this promotion to be enabled for one customer you should select the sales type as Customer and entered the specific sales code on the customer tab of the promotion card. The qualification criteria has been setup to grant a new line when a minimum quantity of any 1 item within the promotion item group \u201cMonitor\u201d has been entered on the sales document. The promotion benefit is a new line on the order for a quantity of 1, for this allocate 100% -line discount. Allow benefit multiplication has not been selected, this means the customer will only receive one free item even if they purchase more than the minimum quantity. The resulting sales lines after the promotion has been applied show the promotion benefit has been added to the order with a 100%-line discount. Discount on a Minimum Spend Receive 10% off orders over \u00a3200 for a selected item discount group \u2013 for ALL customers For this promotion you are offering all customers a set 10% discount for all items purchased within item discount group A when they spend a minimum of \u00a3200. Therefore, my sales type is set to All Customers, and the criteria type is Minimum Amount at \u00a3200. Also enter the specific item discount group you would like to associate with the benefit. This will target all qualifying lines on the order for items within item discount group A and will generate a line discount of 10% when the promotion is applied to the order. Code5: When you buy a certain Quantity Customers within price group B have promotion codes for a further discount when purchasing a minimum quantity of an item. In this instance you will be targeting a customer price group and offering a further discount when they purchase a minimum quantity of an item. To do this firstly create a promotion code group and create a list of sequential codes which you can send out to all customers within customer price group B. (see Using Promotions codes on how to set these up). These codes can then be used to obtain a 5% discount when the customer purchases a minimum quantity of 5 items. As per the setup above you select the sales type and customer price group I want to aim the promotion at. Granting the promotion benefit depends on the order lines meeting the qualification criteria which in this example must be a line for item 1000 at a minimum quantity of 5 and requires a promotion code from promotion group 5% to be applied. Once the promotion code has been applied to the sales order go to: Functions > apply promotions for the benefit to show on the order. Below we can clearly see the promotion code applied to the document on the Document Promotions Codes FactBox and that the line has been updated with a 5% discount: BOGOF: Buy One Get One Free Free item after X amount minimum spend/minimum quantity. Firstly, populate the general tab on the promotions card with your specific criteria, such as valid to and from dates etc. In this example these have been left blank to show the promotion is valid indefinitely and applies to my local currency as per the general ledger setup. Benefit Multiplication has been enabled, which means that the BOGOF promotion will potentially be multiplied (so if the customer purchases more than one of the item they receive the same purchased quantity free). To allocate who is eligible for the promotion fill in the Customer tab, in this example customers within Customer Price Group 001 will be presented with the promotion (should they be eligible) It is at this point you can further restrict the target customers or open this benefit up to All. To qualify for this promotion customers would have to purchase a minimum quantity of 10, they will then receive one free specified item at a discount of 100%. To set this up populate the Qualification Criteria and Promotion Benefit tabs on my Promotions card as per below: The Promotion Benefit details a new line will be added for item 1110 for a single quantity at a discount of 100%, providing the customer has met the qualifying criteria and purchased a minimum quantity of 10 units. SALE25%: 25% on Item Discount Groups An example using Promotion Codes Promotional discount codes can be used by customers to receive a discount on individual items or the whole order depending on the benefit associated with the code. There is the option of either allocating the codes to a promotion group or having an individual promotion code which is set on the Promotion card. Promotion group codes are used in cases where you send out multiple promotional codes to an X number of customers and want to contain the codes within a set group. As per the setup below each promotional code can be used once only (Max no. of uses). After the code format has been specified I can go to Actions > Generate Codes and BC will create the number of codes automatically using the values in the Number and Type fields, this will then create 20 random number series codes. This promotion group is linked to a newly created promotion card, targeted to all customers and the qualification criteria is set so this is granted when the Promotion Code Type of Group is SALE25%. The benefit is applicable to all items within Promotion Item Group 25SALES and consists of giving a line discount of 25%. In a similar way this can be modified to use an Item discount group rather than a promotion item group, this can be changed from the Benefit Target Item Type field: You can also offer a flat discount Amount per line as opposed to a percentage if needed. This can be done by changing the discount type to Line Discount Amount, then specify the Amount you\u2019d like to deduct in the Discount Amount field. To manage the items within a promotion item group you can use the search tool to find the list view and then open each group code. From the Promotion Item group card, you can add items to the group using the Add Items function under Process, and filter the item list per various fields such as item category code to find the items you\u2019d like to add to the promotion group: Item discount groups are set on the individual item cards. Other benefit target types include cheapest and qualifying lines . You can use a benefit target type of cheapest lines when you want the promotion to apply to the cheapest line on the sales document only, for example in cases where you would want to offer the cheapest line free or at a discounted amount. In the example below, the promotion has been set up to give a line discount of 100% for the cheapest line on the order to gift customers the cheapest line on their order. Similarly, this can be tweaked for offers such as buy one and get one half price, to do this you\u2019d simply set the discount percentage at 50%. When you use target the benefit at qualifying lines only, you have the option to either set up discount amount/percentage for lines that meet the qualification criteria of this promotion. For example, for lines that qualify for the minimum amount or quantity you can discount the lines or offer these at a Set Price. Below the promotion has been set up to give the item a set price of 100.00 when a quantity of 5 are purchased within the Promotion Item Group CHAIR.

It adds Apply Promotion and Un-apply Promotion on the Actions tab. The Apply Promotion action will trigger Dynamics 365 Business Central to check through the enabled promotions on the system and see which ones are a fit for the combination of the customer and the items (and their quantity and values). It will then add them into the sales document where applicable, for example adding a line discount or an extra line giving a product free. If there are no enabled promotions that the combination of this customer and these items qualify for, the user will get this message when attempting to Apply Promotion. When the application is successful you will get a confirmation message like below. The Un-apply Promotion action will remove previously applied promotions from the sales document. All lines will revert to their values without the promotion and extra lines that were added will be removed If the user modifies something (price, discount, quantity) on the lines which are already using the promotion, then they will get an information message and the promotion lines will be deleted from the Sales Document, and reapplied if it meets the criteria and setup of the promotion(s).

You must first navigate to the Promotions page. This can be done using the search function on your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central role centre. The Promotion s List page shows the various promotions that have been created within Dynamics 365 Business Central. This page gives an overview of the promotions, with a brief description, the starting and ending dates for when the promotion will run, and its status of either; enabled or not enabled. There are several buttons relating to the promotions on the list, you can find these under the Process option along the top of the screen. The different options available include: being able to disable and enable promotions within the list. Highlighting the promotion from the list and clicking on the Disable Promotion button, will disable the promotion. The same goes for the button Enable Promotion , this allows user to go through and enable promotions which were once disabled and can now be used for business purposes. NB : You can choose the option Edit List which will allow you to enable and disable promotions from the list rather than going into each promotion card or using the buttons detailed above. Being able to Move Up and Move Down , will change the position of the highlighted promotion in the list. The position of the promotion will determine which one is automatically applied to your Sales Document on Release, especially in scenarios where you may have multiple promotions with the same criteria being met. Copy Promotion (mentioned earlier in the user guide) does as described, as a user simply highlight the promotion you wish to copy and hit the button Copy Promotion. A new promotion will be created copying all the details of the promotion code you had originally selected. The difference between the newly created promotion and the one you copied is that the new one will be Disabled and be given a different No . based on the No. series you have selected in the Sales & Receivables Setup page.

There are 2 options as to the type of promotion code you can choose to apply to the sales document, should it meet the criteria. When using the Promotion Code Type of Group , you must first navigate through the Role centre or use the search to get to the Promotion Code Groups page. This page shows the codes that have been created in the system. Each line here is a group of codes that can be used in a specific promotion. In the General FastTab you can see the code (reference name), a description, the maximum number of uses each code is valid for and the format the code will take. The code format here is: # - represents 0-9 \\@ - represents A-Z ? - represents 0-Z (numbers and letters) Any other characters will be used as they appear in the format e.g . \"SALE-\\@\\@#?\" will give a code of the format \"SALE-AA00\". The Promotion Codes FastTab lists all the codes created for this promotion and tracks the number of uses for each one. The Generate Codes action on the Ribbon of the Promotion Code Group Card allows the user to create more codes for use with this specific promotion. They will inherit the properties set in the General FastTab. The user can determine how many new codes to create and whether they should be sequential or random. NB: You can choose to generate codes multiple times; the sequence will simply follow on from the last created code within the promotion group code. As sequential codes could present too predictable a sequence for customers to possibly guess without being given the code, the user may wish to create randomly generated codes. These will still be valid for the same number of uses. The use of Promotion Code Type of Code works slightly differently, on the basis that if this is setup it is presumed that only one promotion code can be applied to all sales documents applicable for the promotion. The other difference between using Code compared to Group is that code does not have a limited amount of uses against it. The No. of Uses field on the Promotion Code Group Card can be clicked, this will display a list of the documents on which the codes have been used.

Once on the page, go to the FastTab Number Series , and find a field called Promotion Nos. This field needs to be populated should you want to allocate the No. given to each newly created promotion. Allocating a number series means that when you use functions such as; Copy Promotion it will use the No. Series stated in this field. NB: A number series is not created as part of the app install, you will need to create an appropriate number series for promotion cards from the no. series list page or alternatively assign a number to each promotion manually as and when these are created.","title":"Sales & Receivables Setup"},{"location":"Clever%20Promotions/User%20Guide/Promotions%20Card/Customer%20FastTab/","text":"The next FastTab down is the Customer FastTab.

From the list choose one specific customer that this promotion can be applied for. Once chosen, the description field will populate with the chosen customer\u2019s name. If you choose Customer Price Group , when you drill into the Sales Code field a list of your Dynamics 365 Business Central customer price groups (standard Customer setup) will be presented to you.

This is what will happen to the sales document, the actual benefit(s) the promotion will give. There are four types of Promotion Benefit that can applied: to All Lines , to create a New Line , to the Cheapest Line or to the Qualifying Lines . Choosing the Benefit Target Type to be All Lines , implies that you want the promotion benefit to affect all lines on the Sales Document. If this option is selected, you should then choose the Benefit Target Item Type, indicating specifically what type of line you want the benefit to be applied to. Options include: Item, Item Discount Group or Promotion Code. Once you have chosen your Benefit Target Item Type , the last bit of setup is to determine what you would like to happen to each line, your options include applying a Line Discount Amount or a Line Discount %. Once completed an optional confirmation checkbox, Prompt for Confirmation , will (if ticked) allow the user to manually include or exclude lines. If the option New Line is selected as the Benefit Target Type it suggests that, if the Sales Document meets the qualifying criteria of the promotion then a new line will be added to your Sales Document. Choosing this option will automatically populate the Benefit Target Item Type (no drop down to show other options is necessary). You must then choose the Benefit Target Item No . to indicate which item will be added as a new line, as well as New Line Quantity (how much of the new item you want to add), Discount type and Discount Amount , which are mentioned above. If you select the option Cheapest Line , this will give the chosen discount % or amount on the cheapest line of the sales document. If this option is chosen you must also setup the Discount Type and Discount Amount. NB : When looking at the Cheapest Line, it is looking at the Sales Line with the cheapest Unit Price Exclu. VAT The final Benefit Target Type that you can choose is Qualifying Lines, this gives a specific line discount percentage or amount to all the lines which qualify. If the Prompt for Confirmation option is ticked then the user is presented with the Promotion Confirmation dialogue box, this gives a choice of which of these qualifying lines to allow the promotion to apply to. By default all the lines will be selected. One setup field that hasn\u2019t been mentioned yet as part of the Promotion Benefit is Split Benefit Across Target Lines If this option has been left on (this is the default behaviour) it will result in the benefit (the discount) being applied to each of the lines which are targeted (ones that qualify under the Qualification Criteria). For example , if the discount is set at \u00a3120 and three lines are identified as qualifying to receive discount then each of the three lines will receive a \u00a3120 discount, this would give \u00a3360 total discount. If this is left unticked, it will result in the benefit (the discount) being split proportionally across the lines which are targeted (ones that qualify under the Qualification Criteria), so if three lines are identified as qualifying to receive the \u00a3120 discount then it will be spread proportionally over the three lines, giving a total discount of \u00a3120.","title":"Promotions Benefit FastTab"},{"location":"Clever%20Promotions/User%20Guide/Promotions%20Card/Promotions%20Card/","text":"Keeping with the manual setup, when you click on the New button, a Promotion Card will open. The Promotion Card shows the detail for one individual promotion. It gives the filtering criteria for that promotion, this is a specific set of rules that need to be met to qualify for the promotions benefit. The first part of the Promotions Card is the General FastTab . This includes the unique identifier (No.) a brief description of the promotion, along with general rules for the promotion, such as: the date range that the promotion will be valid for (if left blank it will apply on all dates); whether it cannot be combined with other promotions (explained below); if it applies to a specific currency code (blank means LCY \u2013 local currency, taken from the General Ledger Setup ); whether conversion from other currencies is allowed (explained below); whether benefit multiplication is allowed and whether or not the promotion is enabled. Allocating a currency code means the promotion will only apply to sales documents where the same currency code has been assigned. If you have setup a currency specific promotion card, or a blank code to use your local currency, orders you will not be able to apply the promotion to a sales document with a different currency code, it will error stating 'nothing to apply' unless you have selected allow currency conversion on the promotion card. NB : If a promotion is not ticked as enabled, it will not take effect, or be visible as a promotion to apply, even if its qualifying criteria are met. Looking in more detail at the General FastTab, there are two fields which when selected will change the behaviour of the promotion in certain scenarios. The first is Cannot be Combined, this field has a range of options which you can select from: Blank, On Document or On Line. If the option is left Blank, then it means that this promotion can be applied to a Sales document providing you qualify for it. If you choose to set it to On Document , it means that no other promotion can be applied to a sales document where a promotion already exists, even if some of the lines could qualify for another promotion. The final option is On Line, choosing this option means that if a line qualifies for a promotion another promotion cannot be applied to that same line, even if that line qualifies for a different promotion. The second setup field is Allow Benefit Multiplication. Selecting this option determines whether the benefit of the promotion can be multiplied or not. If this tick box has been selected then the benefits will accrue automatically, allowing the benefit of the promotion to be multiplied. For example , with a BOGOF (Buy One Get One Free) promotion, if this option has been ticked on the Promotion Card then it will allow multiplication, so that if the customer buys three of item X they get another three free. However, for some other promotions it may not be practical to have this multiplication effect, for example in a \"spend \u00a3100 on X and get \u00a320 off\" promotion the company may not want to give a \u00a340 discount if the customer spends \u00a3200. In that case on the Promotion Card the user should leave Allow Benefit Multiplication unticked.","title":"General FastTab"},{"location":"Clever%20Promotions/User%20Guide/Promotions%20Card/Qualification%20Criteria%20FastTab/","text":"With the Customer FastTab filled in, we then move onto the Qualification Criteria FastTab . This sets the filter criteria that decides if the specific details on the Sales Document, for that eligible Customer or Customer Price Group, qualify for the promotion. On this tab you can set to filter by minimum quantity, minimum amount, or promotion codes. Below are the different options you have, to determine how to setup your qualification. The first thing to do is setup your Criteria type. If you choose from the dropdown Minimum Quantity (Base), you must also fill in the Amount field, the Item Type (detailed further on in the user guide) and the Item No. field. By choosing this option you are indicating that, to qualify for the promotion, an item on the sales document, matching the Item No in the qualification criteria must have quantity matching or greater than the Amount field in the setup. If you choose to set the criteria type as Minimum Amount, you must also fill in the following fields: Amount, Item Type and Item No. to qualify for this promotion you are indicating that the value of the line with an item matching that of the Item No in your setup must be equal to or greater than the Amount (as a monetary value) populated as part of your qualification criteria. The final criteria type that you can choose is Promotion Code, this is detailed further on in the user guide as there is separate setup around this option. As previously mentioned, there are different Item Types that you can choose from. Selecting any one of these options will affect the way in which both the Item No . field is populated as well as the way in which your qualification criteria will work. If you choose the option Item , then when you use the assist edit (the drop - down arrow next to the field) on the Item No field you will be presented with your Item List. Choosing the option Item Discount Group , your drop-down list will be of the Item Discount Groups you have setup in Dynamics 365 Business Central. NB: Item Discount Groups are applied to Items; the set-up field can be found on the Item card under the Pricing & Sales FastTab The final option to choose from is the Promotion Item Group. Promotion Item Groups are used for assigning a defined set of items to a promotion. A promotion can be created so that when the qualifying criteria are met, items in the Promotion Item Group will receive a discount. Choose New from the Promotion Item Group list to create new groups.

The setup will depend on if you are integrating with a single or multiple shipping agents, if those shipping agents can use the same sized blank labels and if you have multiple label printers. If you have just one agent and one printer then you do not need to configure Label Printer Selections, you can just set a default printer against the agent integration and it will default to that. If you do need it, you can set one or multiple selection criteria. Business Central will look for printers according to the following priorities: User, Shipping Agent Code and Shipment Bin all match User and Shipping Agent Code, Shipment Bin is blank Shipping Agent Code and Shipment Bin match, User is blank Shipping Agent Code matches, User and Bin blank Bin match, User and Shipping Agent Code blank User matches, Shipping Agent Code and Bin blank In the future we plan to let you specify users from Clever Handheld for Warehouse as well as just Business Central, hence the user type field. You can select just one or multiple criteria but it will select the first one it finds based on the priorities above. If you have several printers for the same shipping agent, for instance, one at each packing station, then you could choose to set it by the Shipment Bin. For this to work successfully, you will need to select the shipment bin on the Warehouse Shipment header to the right Bin Code for each packing station. This will look as follows If the printer you wish the label to go to is dependent on the shipping agent, then you only need to set the Shipping Agent.

Note: Clever Dynamics are not experts in hazardous goods and you should confirm with your shipping agent what classifications you need and the detail against each one for your particular circumstances. Note : Hazardous Goods are not supported for all Shipping Agents and Shipping Agent Services. Currently these have only been tested and validated for FedEx.

Provided by your shipper usually against the particular UN Code Hazard Class : The hazard class code for this shipping classification, again this will be specified for UN Code by your shipping agent. UN Code : The UN code is the international list of hazard classes maintained by the United Nations. Again, we suggest you obtain advice from your shipping agent regards the ones you need to use.

Note: This needs to be precise if the consignment is to submit via the API, it is case and space sensitive, please be precise. Packaging Group: Again, this is related to the UN Code and you should confirm the required code (it can be blank) with your shipping agent. Unit of Measure : This is the unit of measure that it required for this Shipping Classification. When we submit consignments for hazardous goods, we must declare the volume of each shipping classification. This requires a common item unit of measure to be defined against each item that is linked to the Shipping Classification. That item unit of measure does not need to be (but can be) the base unit of measure, the sales unit of measure or the purchase unit of measure but does (as all item units of measure do) need to have the quantity per defined to say what its relationship is to the base unit of measure. In the PAINT example above, a paint item might be stocked and sold by the tin but it must have a unit of measure for Litres defined, which if it\u2019s a 500ml tin would be 0.5L.

It is useful to understand barcode symbology\u2019s before reading this document. A symbology is how the pattern in a barcode is converted to / from the data it represents. On top of this the data may or may not be in GS1 format. The GS1 specification allows you to pair data to specific categories. You can include more than one of these in an individual barcode. For example, using the GS1 specification you can include the lot number and expiration date in a single barcode. The GS1 specification is not a symbology \u2013 it is a formatting specification for the data that sits on top of the symbology. Operations in the Warehouse app are driven by a list of data items. For example, a receipt will contain a list of data items specifying what data the app needs to get from the user in order to process the receipt. Each data item may contain one or more GS1 identifiers. When a barcode containing GS1 formatted data is scanned by the app it will check each data item to see if it contains a GS1 identifier that matches a field contained in the barcode. If it does, then the value of that data item is set to the value of that field and the data items are submitted to the server. GS1 Data and Processing Logic Format of GS1 barcodes GS1 barcodes allow you to store data for several fields in a single barcode. For example, you could store the item number and serial number in a single barcode instead of generating a barcode for each field. This has obvious efficiency gains in that a single scan, and a single round trip to the server, can be used instead of separate scans for each field. The GS1 data format uses Application Identifiers (henceforth called AIs) to store the data for each field. Different fields have different AIs. A full list can be seen at https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes/application-identifiers The Warehouse app only supports a subset of these AIs \u2013 see Appendix 1 for a list of these AIs. AIs fall into two categories \u2013 fixed length and variable length. Fixed length items have their length set in the GS1 specification \u2013 for example expiration dates are set to be 6 characters long. Variable length items are ended by a delimiter (typically ASCII character 29) or the end of the barcode if a delimiter is not present. The below diagram illustrates the format of a GS1 barcode: All GS1 barcodes start with a FNC1 character. Following that there must be an AI. If an AI is not present, then it is not a valid GS1 barcode. Following that is the data for that AI \u2013 if it is fixed length then the next n characters are read where n is the length from the GS1 specification. If it is variable length, then characters are read until a delimiter or the end of the barcode is encountered. In our example the barcode\u2019s first AI is for the variable length Serial No. field (21). So, the data is read up to the delimiter to give \u2018SERIALNO\u2019. If there is any data after the end of the last AI\u2019s data, then the process is repeated (excluding the FNC1 check). In our example the next AI is for the fixed length Global Trade Item Number field (01) which must be 14 characters long. The data for this field is \u2018GLOBALTRADEITE\u2019. NB : The text below the barcode is in human readable form. The actual data does not contain the brackets around the AIs. The delimiter (ASCII 29) is also not a visible character in text representations of the data. Processing Logic for GS1 barcodes The below flow chart displays the logic for parsing a GS1 barcode in the Warehouse App: There are a few points to make about the GS1 parsing logic : As previously mentioned GS1 barcodes start with a FNC1 character. Some barcode readers strip this out when the barcode is read but some do not. Also, barcodes may contain GS1 data but omit the FNC1 if they have not been produced in accordance with the GS1 specification (\u2018nonstandard\u2019 mode). Therefore, the first step is to check whether this character exists at the start of the barcode, and to remove it if it does. This character is set to \u2018]C1\u2019 but it can be overridden in the settings (see the \u2018Scanner Setup\u2019 section) if a customer has used an incorrect character when generating their barcodes. The next step is to see if the next 2, 3 or 4 characters match one of the supported application identifiers. If they do not, then the barcode is not valid, and it is not processed as GS1. If an application identifier is detected it falls into two categories: Fixed length identifiers. In this case the GS1 specification says the data must be a specified length \u2013 for example Global Trade Item Numbers must be 14 characters long. In this case the parser will read the required number of characters from the data. If there is not enough data present (for example 14 characters are required in the specification but there are only 12 present) the parser reads the characters that are present and still says the barcode is valid GS1 data. Variable length identifiers. In this case the parser reads the data after the identifier until it encounters the delimiter (a gsep or FNC1) or the end of the data. At the end of the process a series of AIs are returned along with the data extracted from the barcode for each AI. Processing Logic The below flow chart displays what the warehouse app does when it receives a barcode from the scanner. The app supports \u2018strict\u2019 (StandardGS1) and \u2018non strict\u2019 (NonStandardGS1) processing modes. If the scanner does not say it is a GS1 formatted barcode the data may nevertheless still be GS1 compliant. If the app is set to non-standard mode it will try and process this data as GS1 even if the scanner says it is not a GS1 barcode. If parsing the data as GS1 fails, the entire text from the barcode is assigned to the current data item. If the barcode is parsed successfully as GS1 data, the parser returns a list of the AIs present and their data. These are then checked against the data items in the current operation. If a scanned AI matches the AI for a data item, then the value of that data item is set to the data for that AI. Appendix 3 lists the AIs that are defined for each operation. Supported Scanners The Warehouse app can work with Honeywell and Zebra scanners. The below tables say which scanners should work with the app according to the manufacturer\u2019s documentation, and which scanners we have actually tested. Honeywell Scanners We use version 1.31 of the Honeywell Barcode reader SDK. This supports the below models: Model Name Android Version Tested Notes CN51 Marshmallow Y CN75, CN75e, CK75 Marshmallow Dolphin CN80 Nougat Dolphin CT50 KitKat, Marshmallow Dolphin CT60 Nougat Dolphin 75e KitKat, Marshmallow EDA50, EDA50K, EDA70 Nougat EDA60K Nougat Y This device is not listed in the release notes from the Honeywell SDK but it works NB : That some Honeywell scanners are not configured to return the GS1 delimiter by default \u2013 so parsing of variable length GS1 data may give incorrect results. To enable the scanner to return this delimiter scan this barcode: Zebra Scanners We use version 4 of the Zebra SDK (Symbol. Xamarin EMDK). This supports the below models: Model Name Android Version Tested Notes MC33 Nougat, Oreo Y PS20 Oreo TC20 Nougat TC25 Nougat TC51 Marshmallow, Nougat TC52 Oreo TC56 Marshmallow, Nougat TC57 Oreo TC70x Marshmallow, Nougat TC72 Oreo TC75x Marshmallow, Nougat TC77 Oreo VC80x Nougat WT6000 Nougat RS507 - RS6000 - RS5000 - RS4000 - DS2278 - DS3678 - DS3608 - LI3608 - LI3678 - TC8000 Lollipop Y This device is supported in a previous version of the Zebra SDK. It works with V4 of the SDK, but not all barcode formats in V4 of the SDK are supported (it does not support Gs1DataMatrix and Gs1QRCode) Android Scanners We support version 4.1 and above. Scanner Set Up In the Warehouse app the scanner can be configured in the Device tab of the settings screen: The fields are: Manufacturer \u2013 this lets you choose the scanner you wish to use. What you can choose depends on the device the app is running on. If the device has a camera one of the options will be Camera \u2013 this will use the Android camera and the ZXing barcode library. If the device has a built-in scanner then this will be selected by default. Barcode Processing \u2013 whether to use \u2018StandardGS1\u2019 (strict) or NonStandardGS1 (non-strict) mode when processing a barcode. See the flowchart earlier in Processing Logic for how it affects the processing. Alternative FNC1 \u2013 if this is populated then the value entered is used instead of the normal FNC1 when a barcode is processed. If nothing is chosen in the Manufacturer field, then no barcodes will be processed in the app. There is a distinction between scanners that can be started automatically (e.g. built in scanners) and those that need to be triggered by the user (e.g. the device\u2019s camera.) The automatic scanners are enabled in the background when barcode input is appropriate - the user then just scans a barcode using the trigger on the device. For the manual scanners a button is added to the user interface which the user must tap to open the scanner. The app detects which scanners are present automatically, with one caveat. When the method in the Honeywell SDK to detect the scanners runs on a non-Honeywell device it crashes the thread the detection processes runs on, meaning no scanners are detected. To get around this the Honeywell detection only runs on devices whose manufacturer is a known Honeywell manufacturer. Currently these include Honeywell and Foxconn . If in future another manufacturer needs to be supported, they can be added to by putting an XML file in the below format at Android/data/com.tecman.Warehouse/files/HoneywellDeviceNames.xml Scanner Diagnostics The app contains a diagnostic facility (as of version 1.0.12.0) which lets the user scan a barcode and see how the app has processed it. It can be accessed from the main menu by viewing going to the hidden buttons (drag the left-hand side of the screen to the right) and selecting \u2018Scanner Diagnostics.\u2019 It uses the scanner that has been set up in the settings screen, if a scanner has not been configured in the app it will display a message advising you of this. This screen contains a Supported GS1 Idents button. Tapping this displays a list of app idents supported by the app (see appendix 1 for a list of these). If the scanner is an automatically starting one (e.g. a built-in scanner) a label will be displayed asking you to scan a barcode. Otherwise (e.g. for a scanner using the camera) a button is displayed which needs to be tapped for you to scan a barcode. The screen also displays the selected scanner and the GS1 option: After a barcode has been scanned the symbology, data format (GS1 or text) and raw text are displayed, and whether it was parsed as a GS1: If the barcode was parsed as a GS1 the values for each detected app ident are displayed. Appendix 1 \u2013 supported application identifiers in the app The below table displays the AIs currently supported (as of version 1.0.12.0) in the Warehouse app. Code Description Length Divisor 00 Serial shipping container code (SSCC) 18 N/A 01 Global trade item number (GTIN / SSC) 14 N/A 02 GTIN of contained trade items 14 N/A 10 Batch or lot number Variable (20) N/A 11 Production Date 6 (YYMMDD) N/A 15 Best before date 6 (YYMMDD) N/A 17 Expiration date 6 (YYMMDD) N/A 21 Serial number Variable (20) N/A 240 Additional product identification assigned by the manufacturer Variable (30) N/A 243 Packaging component number Variable (20) N/A 30 Variable count of items (quantity) Variable (8) N/A 3100 Net weight (kg) 6 N/A 3101 Net weight (kg) 6 10 3102 Net weight (kg) 6 100 3103 Net weight (kg) 6 1000 3104 Net weight (kg) 6 10000 3105 Net weight (kg) 6 100000 3106 Net weight (kg) 6 1000000 3107 Net weight (kg) 6 10000000 3108 Net weight (kg) 6 100000000 3109 Net weight (kg) 6 1000000000 37 Count of trade items (quantity) Variable (8) N/A 403 Routing code Variable (30) N/A 91 Company internal information (weight) 1 N/A If the divisor field is set then the value for that application identifier is divided by the divisor\u2019s value. For example, if the value for the AI 3103 is 1568 then the parser will return 1568 / 1000 = 1.568.

It is useful to understand barcode symbology\u2019s before reading this document. A symbology is how the pattern in a barcode is converted to / from the data it represents. On top of this the data may or may not be in GS1 format. The GS1 specification allows you to pair data to specific categories. You can include more than one of these in an individual barcode. For example, using the GS1 specification you can include the lot number and expiration date in a single barcode. The GS1 specification is not a symbology \u2013 it is a formatting specification for the data that sits on top of the symbology. Operations in the Warehouse app are driven by a list of data items. For example, a receipt will contain a list of data items specifying what data the app needs to get from the user in order to process the receipt. Each data item may contain one or more GS1 identifiers. When a barcode containing GS1 formatted data is scanned by the app it will check each data item to see if it contains a GS1 identifier that matches a field contained in the barcode. If it does, then the value of that data item is set to the value of that field and the data items are submitted to the server.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Handheld/Barcode%20Processing/#gs1-data-and-processing-logic","text":"","title":"GS1 Data and Processing Logic"},{"location":"Handheld/Barcode%20Processing/#format-of-gs1-barcodes","text":"GS1 barcodes allow you to store data for several fields in a single barcode. For example, you could store the item number and serial number in a single barcode instead of generating a barcode for each field. This has obvious efficiency gains in that a single scan, and a single round trip to the server, can be used instead of separate scans for each field. The GS1 data format uses Application Identifiers (henceforth called AIs) to store the data for each field. Different fields have different AIs. A full list can be seen at https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes/application-identifiers The Warehouse app only supports a subset of these AIs \u2013 see Appendix 1 for a list of these AIs. AIs fall into two categories \u2013 fixed length and variable length. Fixed length items have their length set in the GS1 specification \u2013 for example expiration dates are set to be 6 characters long. Variable length items are ended by a delimiter (typically ASCII character 29) or the end of the barcode if a delimiter is not present. The below diagram illustrates the format of a GS1 barcode: All GS1 barcodes start with a FNC1 character. Following that there must be an AI. If an AI is not present, then it is not a valid GS1 barcode. Following that is the data for that AI \u2013 if it is fixed length then the next n characters are read where n is the length from the GS1 specification. If it is variable length, then characters are read until a delimiter or the end of the barcode is encountered. In our example the barcode\u2019s first AI is for the variable length Serial No. field (21). So, the data is read up to the delimiter to give \u2018SERIALNO\u2019. If there is any data after the end of the last AI\u2019s data, then the process is repeated (excluding the FNC1 check). In our example the next AI is for the fixed length Global Trade Item Number field (01) which must be 14 characters long. The data for this field is \u2018GLOBALTRADEITE\u2019. NB : The text below the barcode is in human readable form. The actual data does not contain the brackets around the AIs. The delimiter (ASCII 29) is also not a visible character in text representations of the data.","title":"Format of GS1 barcodes"},{"location":"Handheld/Barcode%20Processing/#processing-logic-for-gs1-barcodes","text":"The below flow chart displays the logic for parsing a GS1 barcode in the Warehouse App: There are a few points to make about the GS1 parsing logic : As previously mentioned GS1 barcodes start with a FNC1 character. Some barcode readers strip this out when the barcode is read but some do not. Also, barcodes may contain GS1 data but omit the FNC1 if they have not been produced in accordance with the GS1 specification (\u2018nonstandard\u2019 mode). Therefore, the first step is to check whether this character exists at the start of the barcode, and to remove it if it does. This character is set to \u2018]C1\u2019 but it can be overridden in the settings (see the \u2018Scanner Setup\u2019 section) if a customer has used an incorrect character when generating their barcodes. The next step is to see if the next 2, 3 or 4 characters match one of the supported application identifiers. If they do not, then the barcode is not valid, and it is not processed as GS1. If an application identifier is detected it falls into two categories: Fixed length identifiers. In this case the GS1 specification says the data must be a specified length \u2013 for example Global Trade Item Numbers must be 14 characters long. In this case the parser will read the required number of characters from the data. If there is not enough data present (for example 14 characters are required in the specification but there are only 12 present) the parser reads the characters that are present and still says the barcode is valid GS1 data. Variable length identifiers. In this case the parser reads the data after the identifier until it encounters the delimiter (a gsep or FNC1) or the end of the data. At the end of the process a series of AIs are returned along with the data extracted from the barcode for each AI.","title":"Processing Logic for GS1 barcodes"},{"location":"Handheld/Barcode%20Processing/#processing-logic","text":"The below flow chart displays what the warehouse app does when it receives a barcode from the scanner. The app supports \u2018strict\u2019 (StandardGS1) and \u2018non strict\u2019 (NonStandardGS1) processing modes. If the scanner does not say it is a GS1 formatted barcode the data may nevertheless still be GS1 compliant. If the app is set to non-standard mode it will try and process this data as GS1 even if the scanner says it is not a GS1 barcode. If parsing the data as GS1 fails, the entire text from the barcode is assigned to the current data item. If the barcode is parsed successfully as GS1 data, the parser returns a list of the AIs present and their data. These are then checked against the data items in the current operation. If a scanned AI matches the AI for a data item, then the value of that data item is set to the data for that AI. Appendix 3 lists the AIs that are defined for each operation.","title":"Processing Logic"},{"location":"Handheld/Barcode%20Processing/#supported-scanners","text":"The Warehouse app can work with Honeywell and Zebra scanners.

The automatic scanners are enabled in the background when barcode input is appropriate - the user then just scans a barcode using the trigger on the device. For the manual scanners a button is added to the user interface which the user must tap to open the scanner. The app detects which scanners are present automatically, with one caveat. When the method in the Honeywell SDK to detect the scanners runs on a non-Honeywell device it crashes the thread the detection processes runs on, meaning no scanners are detected.

In reality, all transactional functions on the device use the same mechanism meaning that the device client focuses purely on rendering a user interface while the framework plus extensions drive the entire transaction. The user is currently signed into the WHITE warehouse. Round Trip #1 The first-round trip is made. At this point the device has no validation or contextual data and does not know what Data Items are required to process the receipt. The framework/handheld for warehousing returns the following response data\u2026 DataItem Name Value Locked DocumentNo \\<blank> FALSE SourceDocument \\<blank> TRUE SourceType \\<blank> TRUE LocationCode \\<blank> TRUE NoOfLabels 1 TRUE ItemNo \\<blank> FALSE VariantCode \\<blank> FALSE Description \\<blank> TRUE UnitOfMeasure \\<blank> TRUE QtyOutstanding \\<blank> TRUE LotNo \\<blank> FALSE SerialNo \\<blank> FALSE Quantity \\<blank> FALSE ExpirationDate \\<blank> FALSE WarrantyDate \\<blank> FALSE No ColumnStyle data is returned, we do not have anything to display at this point (Although we could if we needed to). When a Data Item is marked as Locked the device will not prompt for it. This data may be there for contextual or display purposes, or it may be unlocked later in the process. Notice that the SourceDocument, SourceType, Description, UnitOfMeasure and QtyOutstanding DataItems are locked at the outset. These will be used for display purposes to guide the user as the transaction progresses. Notice that VariantCode, LotNo, SerialNo, ExpirationDate and WarrantyDate are not currently locked \u2013 these may or may not become locked once ItemNo is entered or scanned dependent upon whether the Item is \u2018Item Tracked\u2019. Round Trip #2 Now the device knows what pieces of data are required to complete a receipt transaction and it asks the user to enter the first unlocked DataItem : DocumentNo. The user enters the purchase order number on the supplied documentation (For the sake of the example let\u2019s say Purchase Order No. 106044 ). The following validation data is sent. DataItem Name Value DocumentNo 106044 DataItem Name Value Locked SourceDocument \\<blank> TRUE SourceType \\<blank> TRUE LocationCode \\<blank> TRUE NoOfLabels 1 TRUE ItemNo \\<blank> FALSE VariantCode \\<blank> FALSE Description \\<blank> TRUE UnitOfMeasure \\<blank> TRUE QtyOutstanding \\<blank> TRUE LotNo \\<blank> FALSE SerialNo \\<blank> FALSE Quantity \\<blank> FALSE We have not collected much contextual data so far, but it is also passed to the Clever Handheld Framework\u2026 As previously stated, the framework does not maintain context internally \u2013 it\u2019s far simpler to maintain the small amount of contextual data on the device and pass it with each round trip. Why do we do this? Because as the transaction progresses, we need to retain this information to complete the receipt; we cannot complete a receipt without the document number, item number, variant (If required), quantity etc. and we cannot validate an item without knowing the document number. Clever Handheld for Warehousing now knows that it needs to validate a Document No. of 106044.

This is what the device screen now displays\u2026 The device is displaying only the ColumnStyle data returned, even though more data has been collected. The device is now prompting for Item No. as the next unlocked DataItem . Round Trip #3 The user is required to enter an Item No. as the next unlocked DataItem . The user could enter each piece of information separately but in this case, scans a GS1-128 barcode which contains three pieces of information: Item No., Lot No. and Quantity. Even though the device is prompting for Item No. Handheld for Warehousing and the framework have told the device which DataItems match up to the GS1 identifiers for Item No., Lot No. and Quantity, so they are automatically assigned to the correct DataItem . The solution is designed so that this only requires one round trip rather than three separate trips. There is a time-cost with each round-trip that is largely authentication with the web service, so it is more expedient to collect the information together.

The lot number in this case is ignored because item number 1200 is not lot tracking on this system.

Trans. Shipment Mgt."},{"location":"Handheld/Developers%20Guide/Sender%20and%20Session%20Functions/","text":"There are many critical functions for processing DataItems in both the Clever Handheld Framework and Clever Handheld for Warehousing. All Handheld for Warehousing events pass .Sender , but as the Clever Handheld Framework is generally two-steps removed the base functions are accessible only via the HHF Session Mgt. Codeunit (Referred to below as SessionMgt ). HHF Session Mgt is a singleton, or single-instance codeunit. To clarify, when subscribed to an event in Clever Handheld for Warehousing you can use .Sender to gain access to public functions in Handheld for Warehousing, but to access the functions in the framework (For instance InitialiseDataItem) you will need to go via HHF Session Mgt. HHF Session Mgt. also maintains useful session data such as whether this is a handheld session, current user, current device, current location etc. SessionMgt.GetContent GetContent(DataItemName : Text) : Text GetContent is used to get the data held in a DataItem. For instance, SessionMgt.GetContent('ItemNo') will return the value of the ItemNo DataItem . SessionMgt.SetContent SetContent(DataItemName : Text;DataItemValue : Text) : Text SetContent is used to set the data held in a DataItem. Example: SessionMgt.SetContent('ItemNo',\u20191100\u2019) This will set the value of the ItemNo DataItem to \u201c1100\u201d. This does not set the Locked Property of the DataItem. To set this Property, see the SetResponseData function. SessionMgt.InitResponseData InitResponseData(DataItemName : Text;DataItemCaption : Text;ItemLock : Boolean) InitResponseData is primarily used to initialise DataItems at the start of a transaction or immediately following a \u2018POST\u2019 action. Example: SessionMgt.InitResponseData('ItemNo', ItemJnlLine.FIELDCAPTION(\u201cItem No.\u201d), FALSE); SessionMgt.InsertResponseData InsertResponseData(DataItemName : Text; BeforeDataItem : Text;DataItemCaption : Text;ItemLock : Boolean) InsertResponseData is as per InitResponseData but inserts the DataItem between other DataItems. SessionMgt.AddGS1AppIdent AddGS1AppIdent(DataItemName : Text;Ident : Integer) Usually follows immediately after InitResponseData , this applies a GS1 Application Identifier to the DataItem. Example: SessionMgt.SetResponseData SetResponseData(DataItemName : Text;ContentValue : Text;ItemLock : Boolean) SetResponseData sets the value of a particular Response DataItem and can then lock the DataItem on the device. Example: SessionMgt.SetResponseData(\u2018ItemNo\u2019, Item.\u201dNo.\u201d, TRUE); SessionMgt.GetTransLocked GetTransLocked(DataItemName : Text) : Boolean GetTransLocked is used to return the locked state of the DataItem as a Boolean. It is specific to transactional processing. Example: This will return the Locked Property of the ItemNo DataItem to the SetResponseData function and use it to set the Locked Property. SessionMgt.AddTransColumnStyleGroup AddTransColumnStyleGroup(GroupName : Text;GroupCaption : Text) A ColumnStyleGroup is a grouping of ColumnStyles, this is purely a visual element for grouping related data together on the device. Each ColumnStyle must belong to a ColumnStyleGroup. This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.InsertTransColumnStyleGroup InsertTransColumnStyleGroup(GroupName : Text; InsertGroupName : Text;GroupCaption : Text) As per AddTransColumnStyleGroup , but inserts between other groups. SessionMgt.AddTransColumnStyle AddTransColumnStyle(GroupName : Text;ColumnName : Text;ColumnCaption : Text;ColumnWidth : Decimal) A ColumnStyle is a purely visual element to be displayed on the device to the user. It must map to an existing DataItem name. Below is an Example of a ColumnStyle and ColumnStyleGroup: This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.GetTransResponseCode GetTransResponseCode() : Text GetTransResponseCode is used to return the value of the ResponseCode. Example: IF SessionMgt.GetTransResponseCode = \u2018YESNO\u2019 THEN This will return the ResponseCode Property. If it has been set then the Client will show a prompt. See the Yes \\ No Prompt Example further on in the Developers Guide for a full example of how to us this function. This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.GetTransConfirmed GetTransConfirmed() : Text GetTransConfirmed is used to return the value of the ConfirmedFlag. Example: IF UPPERCASE(SessionMgt.GetTransConfirmedFlag) = 'FALSE' THEN This will check the value of the ConfirmedFlag. It will only have been set if the prompt Box (i.e Yes \\ No) has shown and the user has selected a value. Otherwise it\u2019s value will be blank. Here is a table of the ConfirmFlag values: For more information see the Yes \\ No Prompt Example later in the guide for a full example of how to us this function. This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.SetTransResponseCode SetTransResponseCode(ResponseCode2 : Text) SetTransResponseCode is used to set the value of the ResposeCode for the confirmation message. Example: SessionMgt.SetTransResponseCode(\u2018YESNO\u2019); This will set the value of the ResponseCode variable to YESNO. This will tell the client to prompt for a Yes \\ No response from the user. This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.SetTransResponseMessage SetTransResponseMessage(ResponseMessage2 : Text) SetTransResponseMessage is used to set the value of the ResposeMessage for the confirmation message. Example: Session.SetTransResponseMessage(\u2018Are you sure you want to do that thing?\u2019); This will set the value of the ResponseMessage variable to \u2018Are you sure you want to do that thing?\u2019. This will be displayed to the user when the prompt is displayed. For more information see the Yes \\ No Prompt Example for a full example of how to us this function. This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.SetDeviceUserID SetDeviceUserID(DeviceName2 : Text[50];UserID2 : Code[20];LocationCode2 : Code[20]) SetDeviceUserID is used to set the user and \\ or location for a specific device. SessionMgt.GetDeviceUserID GetDeviceUserID() : Code[20] GetDeviceUserID is used to get the user ID running on the device which makes the request. SessionMgt.AddTransLookupColumnStyle AddTransLookupColumnStyle(ParentDataItem : Text;ColumnName : Text;ColumnCaption Text;ColumnTableNo : Integer;ColumnFieldNo : Integer;ColumnImportance : Integer) Part of the replacement suite of functions for BuildResponseLookup . The new functions allow multiple columns in a lookup with the ability to specify the \u2018Importance\u2019 of a column of data. AddTransLookupColumnStyle should always be used to specify the columns to be displayed before populating the lookup. Once Columns are set the developer may either use BuildTransLookup to build a lookup from a RecordRef, or AddTransLookupRow and AddTransLookupRowColumn to build a lookup manually. For a full example of how to use this see BuildTransLookup . This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.BuildTransLookup BuildTransLookup(DataItemName : Text;LookupTable : RecordRef) Part of the replacement suite of functions for BuildResponseLookup . The new functions allow multiple columns in a lookup with the ability to specify the \u2018Importance\u2019 of a column of data. Before using this function, the developer should use AddTransLookupColumnStyle to specify the data to be displayed. The RecordRef/table can be filtered and sorted prior to calling BuildTransLookup . Temporary tables can also be used. For cases where it is not possible to build a lookup from a table, see the AddTransLookupRow and AddTransLookupRowColumn functions. Example : This example builds a list of purchase orders against a DataItem called \u2018DocumentKey\u2019. On the device, a list of purchase orders is displayed showing Document No. and Vendor Order No \u2026 Clicking on the + key reveals the additional Order Date and Expected Receipt Date values\u2026 This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.AddTransLookupRow AddTransLookupRow(ParentDataItem : Text;LookupKey : Text) Before using this function, the developer should use AddTransLookupColumnStyle to specify the data to be displayed. BuildTransLookup should be used in preference where a table is available (Temporary or otherwise). This function specifies a new row for the lookup \u2013 individual columns should be added using AddTransLookupRowColumn . Example: The above code sets a lookup against DataItem \u2018ActStatus\u2019, then manually adds three rows: Full, Part or None. This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.AddTransLookupRowColumn AddTransLookupRowColumn(ParentDataItem : Text;ColumnName : Text;ColumnValue : Text) This function populates a column in an existing row for the lookup \u2013 rows should be added using AddTransLookupRow . Example: This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.DeleteTransLookup DeleteTransLookup(DataItemName : Text) Deletes all lookup data against the parent data item specified in DataItemName . This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.AddTransSubFunction AddTransSubFunction(SubFunctionName : Text;SubFunctionCaption : Text) AddTransSubFunction can be used to create a custom child function of the current function. This will appear on the device under an ellipsis menu (\u2026) When a sub function is selected, the validate event for the parent function is called. The name of the sub function is written into the \u201cRequestSubFuncCode\u201d variable. The developer can check: That this variable is not blank Which function name this variable has been set to \u2026 and then act accordingly. This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.ValidateTransDataItem ValidateTransDataItem(DataItemName : Text;ContentValue : Text;ItemLock : Boolean) ValidateTransDataItem can be used to fire Validation again for a data item. Will allow the developer to set a DataItem with a new value and force it to validate, without having to copy any of the standard validation code into their bespoke codeunit. Example: For a full example of how to use this see the ValidateDataItem example. One potential danger with this function is that it might cause the code to end up in an infinite loop. Once an item has been Validated, its Data State is set from \u201cValidate\u201d to \u201cContext \u201c. This function works by setting it back to \u201cValidate\u201d again. It is important to use this function with care. To guard against this eventuality, Handheld Framework counts the number of times that a DataItem has been Validated. If the same item has been validated more than 2 times, then it will throw an error: This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.GetHandheldSession GetHandheldSession() : Boolean Can be used to determine if we are running in a Handheld session. Useful when customising and extending functionality. SessionMgt.GetTransResponseDataType GetTransResponseDataType(DataItemName : Text) : Integer GetTransResponseDataType returns the ResponseDataType of the DataItem. The ResponseDataType can be used to change the behaviour of the DataItem. For example, if the ResponseDataType is Masked then when the DataItem is prompted for, text entered will appear as \u201c***\u201d (password characters). Example: ResponseDataType := SessionMgt.GetTransResponseDataType(\u2018ItemNo\u2019); This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.SetTransResponseDataType SetTransResponseDataType(DataItemName : Text;DataItemType : ' ,Masked') SetTransResponseDataType sets the ResponseDataType of the DataItem. The ResponseDataType can be used to change the behaviour of the DataItem. For example, if the ResponseDataType is Masked then when the DataItem is prompted for, text entered will appear as \u201c***\u201d (password characters). Example: SessionMgt.SetResponseDataType(\u2018Password\u2019,MobileContent.Type::Masked); This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.RemoveTransColumnStyleGroup RemoveTransColumnStyleGroup(GroupName : Text) RemoveTransColumnStyleGroup can be used to remove an entire group of DataItems from the display without removing it from the underlying contextual data. ItemNo is often displayed as a group of ItemNo and Description. If you were to remove the ItemNo ColumnStyleGroup this would remove both ItemNo and Description from the display. Example: SessionMgt.RemoveTransColumnStyleGroup(\u2018ItemNo\u2019); This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.RemoveTransColumnStyle RemoveTransColumnStyle(ColumnName : Text) RemoveTransColumnStyle can be used to remove a single DataItem from the display without removing it from the underlying contextual data. ItemNo is often displayed as a group of ItemNo and Description. If you were to remove the ItemNo ColumnStyle this would remove Only ItemNo and not Description from the display. Example: SessionMgt.RemoveTransColumnStyle(\u2018ItemNo\u2019); This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.GetTransFixedDataItem GetTransFixedDataItem(DataItemName : Text) : Boolean GetTransFixedDataItem returns the Boolean value for whether the supplied DataItem is Fixed. If a DataItem is Fixed, this means that it is mandatory and must have a value. For example, the Item No. is mandatory on a Pick as this must be supplied for the pick to work. If a DataItem is set as Non-Fixed, then this means that it is optional and does not have to be supplied for the process \\ function to work. For example, Shipping Agent Code is not Fixed in the Shipping function. If a DataItem is not fixed, this means that it can be disabled. Disabling it will mean that it will not be prompted for on the Device Client (the value for this DataItem can still be set through code). SessionMgt.GetTransFixedDataItemEnabled GetTransFixedDataItemEnabled (DataItemName : Text) : Boolean GetTransFixedDataItemEnabled returns the Boolean value for whether the supplied Fixed DataItem is Enabled. SessionMgt.SetTransFixedDataItem SetTransFixedDataItem(DataItemName : Text;FixedDataItem : Boolean) SetTransFixedDataItem sets the Boolean flag \u201cFixed Data Item\u201d for the supplied DataItem to the supplied value. If this value is set to true then the DataItem becomes optional. SessionMgt.GetLocationCode GetLocationCode() : Code[20] GetLocationCode gets the Location Code for the user which made the request.

To get to the Device Enquiries screen you can either go through the Device Functions page as per the screen shot below or using the search function to directly navigate to the page. If you are using the Device Functions page to navigate to the Device enquires page, simply click on one of the functions which has the Type Field populated as Enquiry. You can either select view, edit or drill into the three lines. Click on the Select from Full List option, which will then take you to the Device Enquiries page. You will be presented with a list of all the Enquiry Codes created. Click on the Select from Full List option, which will then take you to the Device Enquiries page. Whichever option you have taken will take you to the same page, the Device Enquiries page. Once on the page you will see how there are already Device Enquires setup these have been imported, these have come from running the Get Default Configuration (detailed at the beginning of the user guide). Each Device Enquiry has a Unique Code , a Description describing what that code means. The Data Source is based on a Table No of where the enquiry will pull the data from in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. By choosing the data source the Data Source Name will automatically populated based on your choice. On the ribbon along the top of the page, options such as: Filters, Columns and Relationships can be selected per highlighted Device Enquiry, these are used to specify required filters on the device, the columns to display, and the related data that we will potentially drill-down to. When you highlight a device enquiry and click on the filters button you are presented with the following page By applying filters to the device enquiry, you are minimising the amount of records presented to you. The example above, shows how filters have been applied to the Item Enquiry function by Location Code and Item No. Location Code is marked as Fixed. This means the device will not prompt for it, it will use the value in the Filter column. Certain \u201creserved words\u201d are allowed in the Filter, for instance %CURRLOC% uses the current location, or %TODAY% uses todays date. All of which means that Location Code in Bin Contents (data Source) is filtered to the current location automatically with no user entry required. Item No. is not Fixed so it will be prompted for. GS1 Ident is set to Item No. so if a barcode is scanned containing a matching GS1 Identifier for Item then it will be used to map to the Item No. filter. The next option down from filters is the Columns. In this page you can modify the columns that you want to be visible when accessed by the user on the device. The fields available are based on the Data Source to display. To add a new column, click on the field labelled Field No , if you know the field you want to add simply type in the no, otherwise use the assist next to the field (three little dots)this will present you with a list of all the fields you can pick from. Mentioned previously these fields are based on your data source. The Column Name will automatically populate a soon as you type in or choose your field no. You have the option to add in a Column Caption to each of the columns in your enquiry**.** If a caption is added this is what your warehouse users will see as the field name rather than the one in the filed Column Name . The next field along determines whether this field should be visible or not. If you have set the field to be visible you can then apply its Importance. There are three levels of importance that you can select or change current setup to be. By setting the column to be Standard \u2026.

In the same area, that the new user is created (detailed further on in the user guide), there is a Device Menu Code option, this is where you can choose which device menu code each user is assigned, depending on job role can see something different. When we talk about Device Menus these are the screens on the device that the user sees, how they look, the size of the button, the colour of the buttons and the functions that enable you to carry out a certain actions when you select them. By default, the rapid start package run on installation will import a default device menu. This device menu contains all functions and actions that you may want to carry out on the device. You can get to this page either through the search on your role centre or using the menus to navigate to it. Once on the page highlight the code already created and click edit. This will open up the setup behind this device menu. The General FastTab is split into three different fields the first is the Code , a unique identifier given to the device menu created. You then have the Description field which describes the device menu. Finally, there is the Default Theme Code , you can change the Default Theme Code to be another code, by using the drop down next to the field and selecting one of the other options available. The list you are selecting from are codes held on the Device Themes page. The codes created give you the flexibility to change the colour backgrounds and buttons on the device. You could create each menu or go as far as each function with its own colour theme. This for example could highlight to the user on the device what process they are currently doing. After the General FastTab there is a section called Hot-Keys. Populating any of these fields allows users to jump in and out of processes without existing one function to carry out another. For example, when a user is doing a pick, they may need to do an item enquiry or a bin enquiry. The Hot- Key Functions fields in this FastTab relate to the buttons on the devices. NB : You may be limited to how many of these fields you can populate based on the device you are using. The final part of the Device menu looks at the functions of the menu, how they are displayed, what the images are to represent the functions, the button colours and the themes behind them. In here you can remove functions that you may not want a particular group of people to work on, or it may not even be part of your business processes. You can modify the Description, making the functions that you are keeping more relatable. For instance, your warehouse employees may not know what a Phys.Inv means, however changing it to Stock Count or Stock Take makes it more relatable to them and what they do in the warehouse. Changing the Device Theme Code , per device function makes the processes clear to the warehouse what needs to be done and more user friendly as they are not being blinded by harsh colours (making it difficult to see the functions on the screen). Setting Thresholds against the functions helps users identify what level is critical to the business day. NB : You should not modify the default Device Menu, instead, use the Copy action on the Device Menu page.

The next page down in the menu is the Device Functions . This page displays all functions that the devices can run. There are two types of functions: Transaction Functions which allow the user to go into the function card and manage how the function will look and present itself to the customer. In here Data Items can be managed. Data Items are individual pieces of information required to complete a transaction. Secondly, Enquiry Transactions these functions have an Enquiry Code populated next to them; you can drill into these codes to create further setup against the enquires. Any Function that is set as Enquiry doesn\u2019t have any data items created for it as it is a function that shows details to the customer based on prompt. These types of device functions will be explained further on in the user guide. To view the breakdown of the function you simply highlight the function you want to view and click on the Edit button, opening a page showing the specifics of that device function. In the General FastTab we can see a break down of the function. The Name field is editable allowing you to change the caption of the function to be more relatable to users who see that function on the device. The next field down is the Type. This simply displays whether the function is simply a transactional one or an enquiry one. If its set as an enquiry function the Enquiry Code field would be populated as well. Auto \u2013 Post when enabled will simply post the transaction once all the data in the function has been captured. If disabled, then the post button will appear on the device requiring the user to click it for the transaction to be processed. As part of our solution and the functions we also have voice processing. If Enable Voice has been switched on then a few other settings need to be populated, these will be detailed further on in the user guide. The next fields along are Confirmation Text and Posting Notification Text . Confirmation Text, the text in here will be repeated back to the user via headset to confirm if the user would like to post the transaction or not. If Auto-Post is enabled there is no requirement to do that. However, if Auto-Post is enabled you could populate the field Posting Notification Text, letting the user know that the transaction is currently being posted. NB : The Posting Notification Text should not inform the customer the transaction has been posted as the posting might fail and an error appear on the screen. It should indicate that it is currently being processed. Below the General FastTab is the breakdown of the function\u2019s columns . These are fields that are essentially visible to the user on the screen. In here you can group the fields, change eth order of where they are displayed and even show its importance. NB: This does not control the prompts the user will be asked for during the functions process. The first field is the Type field. In the drop down there are 2 options Group or Data Item . Creating group in a function is effectively creating a group of data items, and how they will be seen on the screen. The field Name next to the type field will be a free text field if activity is selected. If you choose Data Item this is a list field, you are choosing to show on the device. In both these cases the default setup can be changed to suit the needs of your users. If certain information is required to be visible on screen you can add that in to the columns list or move others out if they don\u2019t need to be seen. The next field along is Name. If your type is Group , then that field is free text field, all you are doing her is labelling the group of data items under it. If your type is Data Item, you must choose from one of the fields available . The list presented are all the data items relating to that function. From this list you can also select bespoke fields if they are available to you. Following on from the Name column is the Caption column. In here you can edit the caption of your Data Items, making them more relatable to the users who see if on the screen. NB : If it is type Group , the caption will be visible on the device. This is more for when looking at the function in Business Central. The final field is Importance , there are 3 options to choose from Standard, Promoted and Additional. By default, all fields are set to Standard , showing them all on the device screen. Any text which is too long and can\u2019t all fit on one line will be truncated when this setting is selected. If you choose for the Data Item to be Promoted the caption and text on the device will appear in red to make it more visible. The text will also be wrapped, so if for example your item description doesn\u2019t fit on one line on the device screen it will drop to a second line. If you select Additional for any of the data items, then a small arrow will appear at the top of the page, when pressed any fields classed as additional will appear on the device screen to the user. By default, these fields of data would be hidden. With your Data Items and Groups now set you can start to manage the columns. Highlighting your Data Item or Group and clicking on the actions Move Up or Move Down will change the placement of that field. To know its display order, you personalize the page in Business Central to show another column Display Order in the Device function screen. The Display Order controls in what order the Data Items are seen on the device screen. The Voice Settings that are managed per data item are explained further on in the user guide. Languages and Captions From the Device Functions and the Data Items page , you can set up different languages and translations for the captions. Changing the Function names and Data Item names have never been easier. From the Device Functions page simply click on the Name field to edit the function name presented to the user. From the Device Functions Data Items page, you would edit the Description field to change the caption and prompt presented to users on the device. To set the captions to be in different languages click on the three little dots next to the Name field (device functions) or description field (device functions data types) opening the Translations page for your selected device function. In here you can then select your Language ID , if you know it simply type it in, otherwise, use the drop-down arrow next to the field to show a list of languages you can choose from. Based on your selection this will populate the field Language Name. Once selected then put in the Translation Text. The language shown on your device will then be based on the Handheld Users , Language ID .

Click on the Movements tile you will be prompted to enter the Bin Code , this is the bin code that the item they want to move is currently in. You will notice that the Location Code and the New Location Code has already been populated. The Location Code is based on the location you are currently logged onto the device as. If you click on that field the device will pop up a message. Clicking Yes will then ask you to scan in the new location that you will be carry out your movement in, saying No you will take you back to the previous screen. You also have the option to change the New Location Code , just like before you click on the field and say yes or no as to whether you want to adjust it. NB : If the New Location Code is a Directed Pick and Put-away location you won\u2019t be able to adjust the new location code field without changing the location code field first. You can\u2019t move stock from a basic location to an advanced location Once the Bin Code is entered, you will then be prompter for the Item No , following this they will need to enter the quantity you want to move, this can be the entire bin quantity or just part of it. From here, they will need to enter the New Bin Code that they wish to move the items to. If this bin has the available capacity, it will allow the user to post. If you Adjusted the LocationCode at the beginning, then after the quantity you will be prompted to enter the New Location Code , before posting the movement. NB : If the items you are moving are Lot or Serial tracked or have a Variant against them, you may be prompted for these details if not held within the item barcode that you scanned at the beginning. Directed Movements Directed Movements are typically planned movements created for replenishment purposes. They can only be used where the location is setup for Directed Pick & Put-Away . The movement is created in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, then distributed to the warehouse employees where they are actioned on the device. Once the warehouse movement has been created it is then for the warehouse employees to carry them out. Clicking on the Dir. Movement tile will prompt the user to first choose whether to action a specific movement or not. If you select Yes, then you will be prompted by the device to scan in the movement number you are working on, if you select No , you will be presented either with the next movement in the Warehouse Movement List in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central not being worked on, by another user . Or you will be presented with a movement that has been assigned to you by your warehouse manager. NB: Movements are assigned to handheld user in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. On entering a movement, you will then be prompted to select which item within the movement you want to action first. You can click on the additional information button to view further information regarding the movement line. Including: The Bin it is currently in and the Quantity that needs moving. NB: This is based on a field on the Handheld Setup page called Move/Pick Line Sel. by Lookup Selecting your item will then prompt you for the Bin code, this is the Expt\u2019d Bin , where you are moving the item from. This is visible on the device screen., you can decide to take the stock from another bin (providing that bin has enough quantity the movement will register) Follow through the remaining prompts required, you will be asked to enter the quantity you wish to move, this can be all or part of the bin. This will the lead to the device asking you which bin you want to move the item to, you will need to enter the Place Bin Code in here, on the device the suggested place bin is visible next to the field Expt\u2019d Place . Once all the data has been validated against Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central the movement line will automatically register. Physical Inventory Journals (Stock Take) The next two buttons relate to doing a stock count. Phys.Inv and Req. Phys. Inv. The stock take can be run a number of ways and as often as you need it to. How to use either of these functions is explained in a separate section of the user guide. Bin Block The next tile along if the Bin Block . This function allows you to block bins from being used during certain movements. You have the option to block bins for Outbound process, Inbound process or All processes. Clicking on the tile will prompt you to enter the Bin Code you wish to block. On entering the bin, you will be able to see the bins current status, detailed in the field Block Movement . To choose the level of block you want to give the bin you need to click on the Options button at the bottom of the device. On selecting the level, you want to block the bin at you will see on the screen how the block movement field has now changed its status to show what you have selected. Click on the Post button to compete the process. Item Cross References The next tile along is the Item Cross Reference function. Using Item Cross Reference allows you to quickly identify the items that you are purchasing from a vendor based on item numbers other than your own. This can also apply to situations where a part has a new barcode that your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central won\u2019t recognize when scanned using one of the other functions As soon as you click the Item Cross reference tile it will prompt you to enter the Item No you want to create the cross reference for. On entering the item no the device will show details relating to that item number. You will then be promoted to enter the Cross-Reference No. Once you have checked the details on screen click Post to complete the function. This will then be visible as a cross references against the item in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, cross reference type Barcode. You will have noticed that on the device there was an Options button. Clicking on that button will give the option to Discontinue Barcode , whether that is in relation to a new cross reference you are creating or an old cross reference you have already against the item. Item Photo The final function that is part of the standard configuration is the Item Photo function. This function allows user to take pictures of items in their warehouse which will then be pulled back to the item card in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. Clicking on the function will you then prompt you to enter or scan in the item no that you are going to be taking a picture of. On entering the item number, you will then be taken straight to your device camera or the button Photo will be visible at the bottom of the screen. Once the picture is taken, click on the OK action, before clicking Post. Clicking on the post action will then show this photo against the Item number you scanned at the beginning. You can find this photo on the item card in the Photo Fact box. Item Attributes Outside of the Standard default configuration setup there are two further functions that can be added to the internal tile. The first is the Item Attr this function allows users to see the items Attributes. Clicking on the function, you will be prompted for the Item No, on entering that you will be presented with a list of attributes. NB: The attributes aren\u2019t specific to the item these are all the attribute codes you have created in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Although the codes aren\u2019t specific to the Item the value applied to each attribute code will be. Within this screen you can also change any of the values already applied to attributes or add values to those which don\u2019t have any. To do this click on the attribute where you want to add a value or change one which has a value and simply type in the new value when prompted. NB : On the device you will see a field called Value, this relates to the data already held against that record. Attributes which are a type option (those attributes setup so you can choose from a list of values) will be presented with a list of options to change to, rather than being prompted to type in a value. Substitutions The second of the extra functions is Substitution. This function allows you to create item substitutions. Substitutions are used when the preferred item is not available. When you click on the tile on the device you will be prompted to enter the Item No. you will then be prompted to enter the items substitution ( Substitute No )so if your orginal item is not available what could be offered up instead. Once you are happy with all the details displayed on the screen, click the Post button. This will update against the item in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

Similar to that of the receiving processes there are visible numbers next to each function indicating how many activities need actioning within your location. If a user selects the Pick tile, they will be asked if they are Entering a Specific Pick? NB: This message will only come based on your Handheld User Setup If you select Yes, then you will be prompted by the device to scan in the pick number you are working on, if you select No , you will be presented either with the next pick in the pick list in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central not being worked on, by another user . Or you will be presented with a pick that has been assigned to you by your warehouse manager. NB: Picks are assigned to handheld user in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. If once you have chosen a pick or a pick has been given/ assigned to you, you decide you want to change it, you can. On the device when the pick information comes up no screen, you can click on the pick number and choose to Adjust/ Cancel the Warehouse Activity Line, by saying Yes you will then be taken to the following screen where you be asked to specify instead which pick you would like to proceed with. As you begin the pick you will first be prompted to enter the Item No. the device will have presented you with the item that it wants you to pick, this will be the first item on the pick in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. By scanning the same item on the screen, you are simply validating against the pick line this is the item you are picking.

To do this click on the Item No. field on the device. When the pop up appears on screen asking whether you want to adjust the line say yes. At the top of the device it will then prompt you for the Item No again. Following one from entering the Item No, you will be prompted to enter a Bin Code, there is an Expected Bin code presented you on the device however at this point you can scan a different bin. The bin code states where you will be picking the stock from. At this point you won\u2019t know whether Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central holds that item in that bin \u2013 it is sometimes the case where stock is physically in a location but systematically it is not there.

There if there no more lines it will go back to the beginning, asking If you would like to Enter a Specific pick or not. If there are more pick lines it will present you with the next line in the pick. During the pick you may be asked to enter the Lot No. this is because your item requires lot tracking. If the item tracking has been added during the sales order process then on the device you will see which lot number you need to pick. If it hasn\u2019t the you can tell the device which lot for the item you will be picking. Advanced Warehousing Picking When setting up your locations for certain warehouse processes, you may decide that you want to setup your warehouse for Directed Put- away and Pick, a setting on the Location card under the Warehouse FastTab. Directed Put-Away & Pick gives you access to advanced warehouse configuration features that can greatly enhance your efficiency and data reliability. In order to use this functionality, you must first set up several parameters in your warehouse location, such as Bin Types and Zones. When doing a pick in an advanced location the first thing that you will be asked is to determine what Zone you are working in. The zones you see on the device come from a setup page called Zones . Zones which have a Bin Type code flagged for Pick will be visible. NB : If you create an entry in the Handheld Whse. Zones if will use entries in that page to show on the device compared to that of the default zones. Once you have chosen your Zone, you will then be prompted as to whether you want to pick a specific pick or not. Once you have selected your option the picking process will be as above, being prompted at certain stages for certain information. Based on how your warehouse runs there are other functions that can be added to the picking process. These include : Ex. Pick, Invt. Pick & Post Pick. These options aren\u2019t visible on the device menus by default but can be added if you prefer to pick using one of these options instead. Ex. Pick When this option is selected you are choosing to do an Express Pick. This option will most likely be used if you are planning on using Advanced Warehouse picking, as Ex. Pick does not prompt for zone, device users will process all lines on pick regardless of which zone they are in. Once the option has been selected like previous pick processes users will be prompted to pick a specific pick yes or no. If the warehouse user chooses No a list of picks for that user will be displayed. Once a selection has been made it run through the pick as described previously prompting at certain points for specific information relating the pick if not given during the scanning of a barcode. Invt. Pick Inventory Picks are used in situations where you require pick processing but not shipment processing, you use the Inventory Picks to organise the picking information, print the picking information, enter the result of the pick, and post the picking information, which in turn posts the shipment of the items. For this function to work correctly there are certain bits of setup that will need to be done to make sure it works. On the Location Card , you need to make sure that you have the Bin Mandatory enabled. You will also need to make sure that the Device menu for that function has been setup correctly, changing the Cue Table ID & Cue Field No. NB : The Picking tile is also linked to a Cue so you will need to modify that as well if you are using inventory picks instead of warehouse picks Once the option has been selected like previous pick processes users will be prompted to pick a specific pick yes or no.

NB: Each sub menu has a back option which takes the user back to the main menu. The number in the records on the Receiving button indicates how many sub processes there are within this function. Receipt The Receipt Function allows the device to receipt goods into the warehouse like a user would do in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. By running this process through the device, it will cut out the need for Goods in documents allowing users to directly updated the receipt lines of the purchase order directly. The number indicated next to the receipt button highlights to the user based on the location they are in (indicated at the top of the device) how many receipts need to be actioned, if the location is changed then a different number would appear. After the receipt tile has been selected the device will prompt the user to enter the Warehouse Receipt Arrivals number that you want to receipt \u2013 this will be the Warehouse Receipt Number On entering the Warehouse Receipt number, you will be prompted to enter the Item No . This will be an item on receipt. If your item is Lot or Serial tracked you will also be prompted to enter this bit of data NB : If you scan in an item that is not on the receipt you will be presented with an error indicating that the item you are trying to receipt in does not belong on this receipt. If the correct item has been scanned or entered you will then be presented with the details relating to the receipt line, including how much the purchase order says should be receipted in. A prompt to enter the Qty to Receive , will then allow the user to say how much of the receipt line they want to physically receipt in (based on how much has been delivered to them) if the full amount has ben delivered they will type in the amount suggested on the device if it is under they can also do that it is known as a partial receipt. NB : You cannot over-receipt on the devices if you have received in more quantity then initially ordered you will need to manually handle the receipt in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. Once the quantity has been entered the user will then be presented with a post button at the bottom of the screen. All data relating to the receipt line will show about including quantity they typed in to receive. If they are happy with everything they simply click the Post button. This will then post the receipt line and give the user the option to receipt another receipt line , or they can go back and use another function. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, the line you have just posted will disappear off the Warehouse Receipt creating a Posted Whse. Receipt . Your posted Whse Receipt document will either be for the full amount or for the partial amount. If it was is for a partial amount then on the Warehouse Receipt the line will still be visible however the Qty. Received will populate with the quantity you just posted leaving an outstanding amount in the Qty. to Receive field. NB: You can also scan the barcode instead of entering the numbers in manually. If a barcode contains multiple pieces of information, then some steps will be skipped as the system will extract all the date from the single scan. The flexibility of our app means there is more than one way in which you might want to process receipts into your warehouse. Standard device functions also include Receipt By Item & Receipt By Vendor . These options aren\u2019t visible on the device menus by default but can be added if you prefer to receipt using one of these options instead. Receipt By Item If this tile is selected the first prompt you will be asked is to scan in the Item No, if it exists on any receipt created for that location (the location you are in on the device) you will then be asked to select which Purchase Order you are working on. You can click on the additional button next to each document shown to see additional fields which help you in determining which Purchase order the item belongs to. Once selected you will carry on receipting as normal populating the Qty to Receive and the posting when prompted. Receipt By Vendor Selecting the tile Receipt by Vendor will first prompt the user to input the Buy- from Vendor No. like the Receipt by Item function you will then be asked which document you will be receipting against. Once selected you will carry on the receipt process as previously described scanning the Item No when promoted and entering the Qty. to Handle before posting the receipt line. Put-Away The second tile in the Receiving menu, is the Put-away tile. The tile allows a user to put-away goods in a warehouse. A put away is created when the receipt lines are posted. However, this will only happen if on the location card you have Require Put-away enabled. To complete a Put-away using the Clever Handheld for Warehousing, the user must first scan the barcode of that Item you want to put-away , this will bring up information regarding that item. The details on the screen will relate to the first warehouse activity line linked to that item, this may not be the put away that you are working on - don\u2019t panic! Once you have entered the Qty. to Handle , so how much of that item you plan on moving within the warehouse, you will then be asked to verify which purchase order you are working on.

After this has been completed, the user will be taken back to the item page, where they can choose to enter another item, or select close to return to the Main Menu. Taking a Photo NB : This functionality only works with Android devices. During the receipt process there is an option to capture a photo. You may use this functionality when goods are damaged, so you need to take a photo in order to explain why the quantity of an item may not have been received in. The option to take a photo will only appear once the Source Document (Purchase Order) has been scanned or selected and the item has been scanned. You will see an options box appear at the bottom of the screen. If you click on it you will be presented with a screen with two functions. One labeled Take Photo and the other is Back. The Take Photo function will use your devices camera functionality to take a picture, once you are happy click the OK button at the top of the screen or Retry to take another picture. In click OK you will be taken back to the receipt process to continue receipting in your item. NB : You can take multiple pictures for one receipt line. You can either take it before you input the quantity to handle, however there is an opportunity before you post to also take a picture if required.

After the receipt tile has been selected the device will prompt the user to enter the Warehouse Receipt Arrivals number that you want to receipt \u2013 this will be the Warehouse Receipt Number On entering the Warehouse Receipt number, you will be prompted to enter the Item No . This will be an item on receipt. If your item is Lot or Serial tracked you will also be prompted to enter this bit of data NB : If you scan in an item that is not on the receipt you will be presented with an error indicating that the item you are trying to receipt in does not belong on this receipt. If the correct item has been scanned or entered you will then be presented with the details relating to the receipt line, including how much the purchase order says should be receipted in. A prompt to enter the Qty to Receive , will then allow the user to say how much of the receipt line they want to physically receipt in (based on how much has been delivered to them) if the full amount has ben delivered they will type in the amount suggested on the device if it is under they can also do that it is known as a partial receipt.

All data relating to the receipt line will show about including quantity they typed in to receive. If they are happy with everything they simply click the Post button. This will then post the receipt line and give the user the option to receipt another receipt line , or they can go back and use another function. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, the line you have just posted will disappear off the Warehouse Receipt creating a Posted Whse. Receipt . Your posted Whse Receipt document will either be for the full amount or for the partial amount. If it was is for a partial amount then on the Warehouse Receipt the line will still be visible however the Qty. Received will populate with the quantity you just posted leaving an outstanding amount in the Qty. to Receive field. NB: You can also scan the barcode instead of entering the numbers in manually. If a barcode contains multiple pieces of information, then some steps will be skipped as the system will extract all the date from the single scan. The flexibility of our app means there is more than one way in which you might want to process receipts into your warehouse.

There are two different ways in which a stock take can be done. The first option Phys.Inv requires some setup to be done first in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. In the client you will need to navigate to the Phys. Inventory Journal or Whse Phys. Inventory Journal pages. If your location is setup for advanced warehousing you will use the Whse Phys. Inventory. Once on the journal you will run the Calculate Inventory action on the actions tab. The request page will pop up asking you what filters to apply to the entries before pulling them through onto the journal. It is up to you how you would like to create your journal. Once the journal is created you can then run the Assign to Device User function which based on your filter options will apply a Device User to a journal line. Or you can go down each line individually and populate Assigned Handheld User the field. NB : Along with assigning to device users the priority can be set if you want the user to prioritise some journal lines over others. On the device you will see that you know have a figure against the tile Phys.Inv. this indicates to the warehouse employee how many lines have been assigned to them to count. To make sure that the figure is populating correctly you need to make sure your Device Menu setup is correct. The Cue field No. needs to be pointing either at Phys. Inv Lines or Whse. Phys. Inv. Lines - if your location is setup for advanced warehousing. Clicking on the Phys Inv tile the user will be prompted to enter the Bin Code . The bin code along with the Item No and other details are visible on the device. NB : You can hide the quantity by enabling the flag blind stock count in the handheld setup page. Once the bin has been entered you will then be prompted for the Item No, like the previous screen the details can be seen on the device. You will finally be prompted for the Quantity, once confirmed a Post button will appear at the bottom of the device. In posting the line you are updating the corresponding line on the journal you created in previously. NB: Posting the entry on the device does not post the line on the journal. The final posting is done in Microsoft Dynamics 365 business Central by someone like the warehouse manager who is happy with the difference in what the client thinks there is in stock compared to what is physically in the warehouse. You will have noticed during the process that an Option button appeared at the bottom of the device. The options in here depend at which stage of the count process you are at. If you have only scanned in the bin code and then clicked on the option button, you will only see Next Bin . If you have scanned in both the bin code and the item code, and then clicked on the option button you will see both Next Bin and Next Item as options. If you were to select the option Next Bin you would be moved onto the next assigned to your device in the journal. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central the journal lines will be updated as follows: By carrying out the action above on the device you have instigated to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central is that the bin you were in has been counted and to move onto the next bin. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central what that has done is checked all the lines relating to the bin that you have scanned and negatively adjusted the amounts of all the lines to be 0 (Qty Phys. Inventory). You will also notice this bin and the lines on the journal have now been set as Counted. Marking the line(s) as counted means it will not reappear back on the gun for recount. To do that you would have to set that field back to needs counting. NB : The Count Status field only gets updated when the count is carried out through a device if it is adjusted manually in NAV then the line will remain as Needs Counting. If when you scan the bin you are presented with an item which is no longer in the bin you can choose the option Next Item . This action will appear once the bin code and the item code has been scanned. Once all the items in the bin have been counted whether that\u2019s through simply counting them as they are all there or using the next bin function it will take you out the loop of staying in that bin and move you onto the next bin, where you will be prompted to scan in the next bin. Similarly, to staying in the bin until the Next Bin function is pressed, if there are multiple lots for an item it will stay in that item until all lots have been scanned or the Next Item function has been pressed. NB : If the items you are counting are lot/serial tracked numbers or variants are applied to them you may also be prompted on the device to confirm those bits of data if not already held in a barcode when scanned. Req. Phys. Inv If you choose to run this option instead you don\u2019t need to need to create a journal beforehand. Instead of user being assigned lines to go and count and being directed. they will instead create the Phys. Inventory Journal or Whse Phys. Inventory Journal. When the user clicks on this option they will be asked to scan the Bin Code as soon as they scan in that bin code they will be presented with the first item in that bin, according to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central . Like the Phys. Inv functionality they will then scan the item and type in the quantity. The same options of Next Bin and Next Item are also available and work just like they did in the other function (Phys. Inv). In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central a journal will be created for that mobile warehouse user. For example, the device is logged in as CDDEMO, in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central you will see that name as a journal batch name. As you start to scan in bins and items the journal will start to populate depending on what I have scanned in. Similarly, to the Phys. Inv function if Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central is telling it that there are two items in a bin and you only scan one of the items and hit the Next Bin option it will create the second line on the journal but have the Qty Phys. Inventory field showing 0. Once either Journal has been completed and the lines updated in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central a user will need to go the correct journal and post it after a quick check has been done. Once the journal is posted that is when the adjustments will be made. NB : If lines need recounting and you want them to be done on the device you will have to change the Count Status back to Needs Counting . If you are making the adjustments through Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central this status is not important.

These fields are however required to make sure that your orders are put on the correct routes and schedules for the drivers so that they know a collection as well as a delivery needs to be made. Purchase Orders will be added to Routes using a Delivery Schedule that matches the Collection Shipping Agent and Collection Shipping Agent Code. For Sales Return Orders: Sales Return Orders that are created with a Shipping Agent Code and Shipping Agent Service Code that match the Collections setup will be added to the relevant Shipment Management Route.

You can specify which report ID you want to print, how you would like the report to be filtered, the sorting method (currently only option is delivery order) and then in ascending or descending order. The status code field allow you to easily link different reports IDs for the various Shipping Agent Codes setup and their respective status codes.

Each Route Status Code represents a process or check within a route which needs to be completed before the route can progress onto the next status. Clicking on the Route Status List will open a window as per below showing a list of the existing status codes. These can be setup manually or you can use the Default Configuration which includes a standardised set of route status codes. Example Scenario In the example above setup of status codes has been done for Shipping Agent codes DHL and OWN LOG. For status codes where the Shipping Agent Code has been left blank this status will apply to routes for all shipping agents, for example all routes will have to process the PLAN status code first. NB: The next code must be specified on each status code to give the list an order, you do not need a next status code on the final stage of your route. Take the example above: Once a route has processed status code 05 PLAN this will be followed by code 10 (as specified in the next Code field). The addition will then run through and will process status code 20 next but will filter for the appropriate Shipping Agent Code for that route. When processing status code 20 it will either run Description Create Shipments or Create Consolidated Shipments depending on whether it is an OWN LOG or DHL route being processed. You can set the processing codeunit ID for each Status Code, Microsoft Dynamics NAV will run this codeunit when you select process for a route from the Shipment Management Routes ribbon or the FactBox. NB : Don\u2019t panic if you don\u2019t know much about the codeunit side of things, you need to be aware of them, but you shouldn\u2019t need to change them from the default configuration unless you have bespoke processes running through your Warehouse. On the screen you will notice against each Route Status code there are a few option boxes. If you select Process Automatically, then you do not have to manually process the status from the Shipment Management Routes screen. Using the example above when you process the 05 Status PLAN for a route Microsoft Dynamics NAV will automatically process code 10 and reserve the inventory, the next status you will manually need to process will be code 20 to create shipments. Choosing to Hide Status means that the code selected will be hidden from the factbox on the Shipment Management Routes screen.

The first thing to do is to navigate to the Shipment Management Setup Page. You can do this by using the search to find the page or navigating through the navigation pane (Departments Warehouse Shipment Management) to get to the page. The Shipment Management Setup page is where general Shipment Management options are defined. The first FastTab to be filled in is the Scheduling FastTab . The Default Region Code is used as the default country/region code for Sales Orders where that field is empty. The Country/Region code needs to be filled in one way or another as it helps in determining the Delivery Area (explained later in the user guide) of the order. The next field to populate is the Default Delivery Area Code. When a Sales Order is created it is given a Delivery Area code based on the setup done in this user guide. As your business starts to expand and you deliver further afield it may be the case that you haven\u2019t had the opportunity to setup new delivery areas to cater to the expansion. To help with this you may want to create a default route or a dummy route where orders can be assigned to and easily identified in the Shipment Managements Route screen to be dealt with later. For example, create a Delivery Route called Unassigned for customers that aren\u2019t currently assigned to a specific Delivery Area Code. The final field on the Scheduling FastTab is Scheduling Time Period, this is the Period for which the Sales Orders will be listed on the Shipment Management Route screen, i.e. how far ahead do you want to plan. Shipment Management Routes will be created for Orders with a shipment date within the Scheduling Time Period.

On the Delivery Area card (explained further on in the user guide), there is a field that determines the Delivery Order . The Custom Sorting Order for Picks field can be used when consolidating shipments and creating one pick for the delivery route rather than individual picks for each order. When creating a consolidated pick, the pick lines will be sorted in the order specified by the Custom Sorting Order in Shipment Management Setup. This makes it easier for a picker to organise the trolley or pallet they are picking onto. Sorting by delivery order will also sort by bin code for each set of pick lines that share the same delivery order.","title":"Sorting FastTab"}]}
