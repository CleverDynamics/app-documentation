Follow up\n  calls/to-dos are automatically diarised and visible in each team members\n  dashboards to remind them when to chase promised payments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I set certain customers to be exempt from the credit rules?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, there is a \nClever Credit FastTab\n on the customer card, which allows\n  you to set different rules for individual customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan all users see the documents that are on Credit hold?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many ways in which a user can see a document which is on credit\n  held.\n\n\nThe first place that it can be seen is on the Sales Document header itself.\n  There is a field called \nOrder Status\n, which indicates the state of the\n  document.\n\n\nAnother area in which users can go to find out which documents are on hold\n  is through the Credit Held List. Doing this they will be able to see all\n  Sales Documents being held.\n\n\nThey can also navigate to the Credit Held List via the \nManage Status\n\n  button on the Sales document ribbon.

These will factor into how many\n  times a document needs to be credit held. If a Sales Order is being Credit\n  Held unexpectedly, particularly after it has already been Credit Released\n  once, it may be related to a currency fluctuation.\u00a0When releasing/shipping &\n  invoicing an error pops up that the order needs to be credit held again,\n  which is correct as the value has increased due to the exchange rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes your App integrate with other systems?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegration to Office365 and Skype for Business\n means actioning\n  follow-up calls or emails to chase for payment are just a click away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan a Sales document be held even after its been credit released?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a document is credit held it sits in the \nCredit Held\n list once\n  released, the order moves to the \nCredit Released\n list and the sales\n  headers status changes to credit released. From the Credit released list\n  users can then highlight the document and click on the \nHold\n button. This\n  process means that you don\u2019t have to reopen or modify the sales document in\n  any way to force it back through the credit held process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am looking at the Clever To-Do\u2019s and can see a To-do for a customer that\n    is not visible in the Clever Credit screen, how is this possible?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is most likely because the Clever Credit has been filtered to a\n  specific credit controller. It could be that the customer is against a\n  different credit controller.\n\n\nNB\n: Removing the filter from eth page won\u2019t clear the filter completely\n  by default the screen will filter to the default credit controller if one\n  has been set in the Clever Credit Setup page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Clever Credit Statics box doesn\u2019t show a figure in the No. of To-Dos for\n    a customer even though I know there is one from them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly open To-Dos will show in here, if you click on the figure and clear the\n  filter applied to the field \nOpen\n the To-do(s) will most likely appear.",

To\n  stop users from having to input a password on certain documents simply go to\n  the \nDocument Type\n, and on the \nFields FastTab\n, simply delete the\n  field \nPassword\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo my documents automatically send once all the setup has been done?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, there is still a requirement for users to click a button, depending on\n  which of the options are selected will depend on when the document is sent\n  (based also on your setup).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though I have changed some of the lines on the order the customer is\n    still receiving an old copy of the order confirmation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is because you on the document type the flag to \nStore Documents\n has\n  been selected.

            "text": "There are many critical functions for processing DataItems in both the Clever\nHandheld Framework and Clever Handheld for Warehousing. All Handheld for\nWarehousing events pass \n.Sender\n, but as the Clever Handheld Framework is\ngenerally two-steps removed the base functions are accessible only via the \nHHF\nSession Mgt.\n Codeunit (Referred to below as \nSessionMgt\n). \nHHF Session\nMgt\n is a singleton, or single-instance codeunit.\n\n\nTo clarify, when subscribed to an event in Clever Handheld for Warehousing you\ncan use \n.Sender\n to gain access to public functions in Handheld for\nWarehousing, but to access the functions in the framework (For instance\nInitialiseDataItem) you will need to go via \nHHF Session Mgt.\n\n\nHHF Session Mgt.\n also maintains useful session data such as whether this is\na handheld session, current user, current device, current location etc.\n\n\nSessionMgt.GetContent\n\n\nGetContent(DataItemName : Text) : Text\n\n\nGetContent\n is used to get the data held in a DataItem. For instance,\nSessionMgt.GetContent('ItemNo') will return the value of the \nItemNo\nDataItem\n.\n\n\nSessionMgt.SetContent\n\n\nSetContent(DataItemName : Text;DataItemValue : Text) : Text\n\n\nSetContent\n is used to set the data held in a DataItem.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nSessionMgt.SetContent('ItemNo',\u20191100\u2019)\n\n\nThis will set the value of the \nItemNo DataItem\n to \u201c1100\u201d. This does not set\nthe \nLocked\n Property of the DataItem. To set this Property, see the\nSetResponseData function.\n\n\nSessionMgt.InitResponseData\n\n\nInitResponseData(DataItemName : Text;DataItemCaption : Text;ItemLock : Boolean)\n\n\nInitResponseData\n is primarily used to initialise \nDataItems\n at the start\nof a transaction or immediately following a \u2018POST\u2019 action.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nSessionMgt.InitResponseData('ItemNo', ItemJnlLine.FIELDCAPTION(\u201cItem No.\u201d),\nFALSE);\n\n\nSessionMgt.InsertResponseData\n\n\nInsertResponseData(DataItemName : Text; BeforeDataItem : Text;DataItemCaption :\nText;ItemLock : Boolean)\n\n\nInsertResponseData\n is as per \nInitResponseData\n but inserts the DataItem\nbetween other DataItems.\n\n\nSessionMgt.AddGS1AppIdent\n\n\nAddGS1AppIdent(DataItemName : Text;Ident : Integer)\n\n\nUsually follows immediately after \nInitResponseData\n, this applies a GS1\nApplication Identifier to the DataItem.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nSessionMgt.SetResponseData\n\n\nSetResponseData(DataItemName : Text;ContentValue : Text;ItemLock : Boolean)\n\n\nSetResponseData sets the value of a particular \nResponse DataItem\n and can\nthen lock the \nDataItem\n on the device.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nSessionMgt.SetResponseData(\u2018ItemNo\u2019, Item.\u201dNo.\u201d, TRUE);\n\n\nSessionMgt.GetTransLocked\n\n\nGetTransLocked(DataItemName : Text) : Boolean\n\n\nGetTransLocked\n is used to return the locked state of the DataItem as a\nBoolean. It is specific to transactional processing.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nThis will return the Locked Property of the ItemNo DataItem to the\nSetResponseData function and use it to set the Locked Property.\n\n\nSessionMgt.AddTransColumnStyleGroup\n\n\nAddTransColumnStyleGroup(GroupName : Text;GroupCaption : Text)\n\n\nA ColumnStyleGroup is a grouping of ColumnStyles, this is purely a visual\nelement for grouping related data together on the device.\n\n\nEach ColumnStyle must belong to a ColumnStyleGroup. This function is specific to\ntransactional processing.\n\n\nSessionMgt.InsertTransColumnStyleGroup\n\n\nInsertTransColumnStyleGroup(GroupName : Text; InsertGroupName :\nText;GroupCaption : Text)\n\n\nAs per \nAddTransColumnStyleGroup\n, but inserts between other groups.\n\n\nSessionMgt.AddTransColumnStyle\n\n\nAddTransColumnStyle(GroupName : Text;ColumnName : Text;ColumnCaption :\nText;ColumnWidth : Decimal)\n\n\nA ColumnStyle is a purely visual element to be displayed on the device to the\nuser. It must map to an existing \nDataItem\n name.\n\n\nBelow is an \nExample\n of a ColumnStyle and ColumnStyleGroup:\n\n\n\n\nThis function is specific to transactional processing.\n\n\nSessionMgt.GetTransResponseCode\n\n\nGetTransResponseCode() : Text\n\n\nGetTransResponseCode\n is used to return the value of the ResponseCode.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nIF SessionMgt.GetTransResponseCode = \u2018YESNO\u2019 THEN\n\n\nThis will return the ResponseCode Property. If it has been set then the Client\nwill show a prompt. See the Yes \\ No Prompt Example further on in the\nDevelopers Guide for a full example of how to us this function. This function is\nspecific to transactional processing.\n\n\nSessionMgt.GetTransConfirmed\n\n\nGetTransConfirmed() : Text\n\n\nGetTransConfirmed\n is used to return the value of the ConfirmedFlag.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nIF UPPERCASE(SessionMgt.GetTransConfirmedFlag) = 'FALSE' THEN\n\n\nThis will check the value of the ConfirmedFlag. It will only have been set if\nthe prompt Box (i.e Yes \\ No) has shown and the user has selected a value.\nOtherwise it\u2019s value will be blank.\n\n\nHere is a table of the ConfirmFlag values:\n\n\n\n\nFor more information see the Yes \\ No Prompt Example later in the guide for a\nfull example of how to us this function. This function is specific to\ntransactional processing.\n\n\nSessionMgt.SetTransResponseCode\n\n\nSetTransResponseCode(ResponseCode2 : Text)\n\n\nSetTransResponseCode\n is used to set the value of the ResposeCode for the\nconfirmation message.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nSessionMgt.SetTransResponseCode(\u2018YESNO\u2019);\n\n\nThis will set the value of the ResponseCode variable to YESNO. This will tell\nthe client to prompt for a Yes \\ No response from the user. This function is\nspecific to transactional processing.\n\n\nSessionMgt.SetTransResponseMessage\n\n\nSetTransResponseMessage(ResponseMessage2 : Text)\n\n\nSetTransResponseMessage\n is used to set the value of the ResposeMessage for\nthe confirmation message.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nSession.SetTransResponseMessage(\u2018Are you sure you want to do that thing?\u2019);\n\n\nThis will set the value of the ResponseMessage variable to \u2018Are you sure you\nwant to do that thing?\u2019. This will be displayed to the user when the prompt is\ndisplayed.\n\n\nFor more information see the Yes \\ No Prompt Example for a full example of how\nto us this function. This function is specific to transactional processing.\n\n\nSessionMgt.SetDeviceUserID\n\n\nSetDeviceUserID(DeviceName2 : Text[50];UserID2 : Code[20];LocationCode2 :\nCode[20])\n\n\nSetDeviceUserID\n is used to set the user and \\ or location for a specific\ndevice.\n\n\nSessionMgt.GetDeviceUserID\n\n\nGetDeviceUserID() : Code[20]\n\n\nGetDeviceUserID\n is used to get the user ID running on the device which makes\nthe request.\n\n\nSessionMgt.AddTransLookupColumnStyle\n\n\nAddTransLookupColumnStyle(ParentDataItem : Text;ColumnName : Text;ColumnCaption\n\n\nText;ColumnTableNo : Integer;ColumnFieldNo : Integer;ColumnImportance : Integer)\n\n\nPart of the replacement suite of functions for \nBuildResponseLookup\n. The new\nfunctions allow multiple columns in a lookup with the ability to specify the\n\u2018Importance\u2019 of a column of data.\n\n\n\n\nAddTransLookupColumnStyle\n should always be used to specify the columns to be\ndisplayed before populating the lookup. Once \nColumns\n are set the developer\nmay either use \nBuildTransLookup\n to build a lookup from a RecordRef, or\n\nAddTransLookupRow\n and \nAddTransLookupRowColumn\n to build a lookup\nmanually.\n\n\nFor a full example of how to use this see \nBuildTransLookup\n. This function is\nspecific to transactional processing.\n\n\nSessionMgt.BuildTransLookup\n\n\nBuildTransLookup(DataItemName : Text;LookupTable : RecordRef)\n\n\nPart of the replacement suite of functions for \nBuildResponseLookup\n. The new\nfunctions allow multiple columns in a lookup with the ability to specify the\n\u2018Importance\u2019 of a column of data.\n\n\n\n\nBefore using this function, the developer should use\n\nAddTransLookupColumnStyle\n to specify the data to be displayed. The\nRecordRef/table can be filtered and sorted prior to calling\n\nBuildTransLookup\n. Temporary tables can also be used.\n\n\nFor cases where it is not possible to build a lookup from a table, see the\n\nAddTransLookupRow\n and \nAddTransLookupRowColumn\n functions.\n\n\nExample\n: This example builds a list of purchase orders against a\n\nDataItem\n called \u2018DocumentKey\u2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the device, a list of purchase orders is displayed showing \nDocument No.\n\nand \nVendor Order No\n\u2026\n\n\nClicking on the \n+\n key reveals the additional \nOrder Date\n and \nExpected\nReceipt Date\n values\u2026\n\n\nThis function is specific to transactional processing.\n\n\nSessionMgt.AddTransLookupRow\n\n\nAddTransLookupRow(ParentDataItem : Text;LookupKey : Text)\n\n\n\n\nBefore using this function, the developer should use\n\nAddTransLookupColumnStyle\n to specify the data to be displayed.\n\nBuildTransLookup\n should be used in preference where a table is available\n(Temporary or otherwise).\n\n\nThis function specifies a new row for the lookup \u2013 individual columns should be\nadded using \nAddTransLookupRowColumn\n.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nThe above code sets a lookup against \nDataItem\n \u2018ActStatus\u2019, then manually\nadds three rows: Full, Part or None. This function is specific to transactional\nprocessing.\n\n\nSessionMgt.AddTransLookupRowColumn\n\n\nAddTransLookupRowColumn(ParentDataItem : Text;ColumnName : Text;ColumnValue :\nText)\n\n\n\n\nThis function populates a column in an existing row for the lookup \u2013 rows should\nbe added using \nAddTransLookupRow\n.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nThis function is specific to transactional processing.\n\n\nSessionMgt.DeleteTransLookup\n\n\nDeleteTransLookup(DataItemName : Text)\n\n\nDeletes all lookup data against the parent data item specified in\n\nDataItemName\n.\n\n\nThis function is specific to transactional processing.\n\n\nSessionMgt.AddTransSubFunction\n\n\nAddTransSubFunction(SubFunctionName : Text;SubFunctionCaption : Text)\n\n\nAddTransSubFunction\n can be used to create a custom child function of the\ncurrent function. This will appear on the device under an ellipsis menu (\u2026)\n\n\n\n\nWhen a sub function is selected, the validate event for the parent function is\ncalled. The name of the sub function is written into the \u201cRequestSubFuncCode\u201d\nvariable. The developer can check:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat this variable is not blank\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich function name this variable has been set to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026 and then act accordingly.\n\n\nThis function is specific to transactional processing.\n\n\nSessionMgt.ValidateTransDataItem\n\n\nValidateTransDataItem(DataItemName : Text;ContentValue : Text;ItemLock :\nBoolean)\n\n\nValidateTransDataItem\n can be used to fire Validation again for a data item.\nWill allow the developer to set a DataItem with a new value and force it to\nvalidate, without having to copy any of the standard validation code into their\nbespoke codeunit.\n\n\nExample: For a full example of how to use this see the ValidateDataItem example.\n\n\nOne potential danger with this function is that it might cause the code to end\nup in an infinite loop. Once an item has been Validated, its Data State is set\nfrom \u201cValidate\u201d to \u201cContext \u201c. This function works by setting it back to\n\u201cValidate\u201d again. It is important to use this function with care. To guard\nagainst this eventuality, Handheld Framework counts the number of times that a\nDataItem has been Validated. If the same item has been validated more than 2\ntimes, then it will throw an error:\n\n\n\n\nThis function is specific to transactional processing.\n\n\nSessionMgt.GetHandheldSession\n\n\nGetHandheldSession() : Boolean\n\n\nCan be used to determine if we are running in a Handheld session. Useful when\ncustomising and extending functionality.\n\n\nSessionMgt.GetTransResponseDataType\n\n\nGetTransResponseDataType(DataItemName : Text) : Integer\n\n\nGetTransResponseDataType\n returns the ResponseDataType of the DataItem.\n\n\nThe ResponseDataType can be used to change the behaviour of the DataItem. For\nexample, if the ResponseDataType is Masked then when the DataItem is prompted\nfor, text entered will appear as \u201c***\u201d (password characters).\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nResponseDataType := SessionMgt.GetTransResponseDataType(\u2018ItemNo\u2019);\n\n\nThis function is specific to transactional processing.\n\n\nSessionMgt.SetTransResponseDataType\n\n\nSetTransResponseDataType(DataItemName : Text;DataItemType : ' ,Masked')\n\n\nSetTransResponseDataType\n sets the ResponseDataType of the DataItem.\n\n\nThe ResponseDataType can be used to change the behaviour of the DataItem. For\nexample, if the ResponseDataType is Masked then when the DataItem is prompted\nfor, text entered will appear as \u201c***\u201d (password characters).\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nSessionMgt.SetResponseDataType(\u2018Password\u2019,MobileContent.Type::Masked);\n\n\nThis function is specific to transactional processing.\n\n\nSessionMgt.RemoveTransColumnStyleGroup\n\n\nRemoveTransColumnStyleGroup(GroupName : Text)\n\n\nRemoveTransColumnStyleGroup\n can be used to remove an entire group of\nDataItems from the display without removing it from the underlying contextual\ndata.\n\n\nItemNo is often displayed as a group of ItemNo and Description. If you were to\nremove the ItemNo ColumnStyleGroup this would remove both ItemNo and Description\nfrom the display.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nSessionMgt.RemoveTransColumnStyleGroup(\u2018ItemNo\u2019);\n\n\nThis function is specific to transactional processing.\n\n\nSessionMgt.RemoveTransColumnStyle\n\n\nRemoveTransColumnStyle(ColumnName : Text)\n\n\nRemoveTransColumnStyle\n can be used to remove a single DataItem from the\ndisplay without removing it from the underlying contextual data.\n\n\nItemNo is often displayed as a group of ItemNo and Description. If you were to\nremove the ItemNo ColumnStyle this would remove Only ItemNo and not Description\nfrom the display.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nSessionMgt.RemoveTransColumnStyle(\u2018ItemNo\u2019);\n\n\nThis function is specific to transactional processing.\n\n\nSessionMgt.GetTransFixedDataItem\n\n\nGetTransFixedDataItem(DataItemName : Text) : Boolean\n\n\nGetTransFixedDataItem\n returns the Boolean value for whether the supplied\nDataItem is Fixed.\n\n\nIf a DataItem is Fixed, this means that it is mandatory and must have a value.\nFor example, the Item No. is mandatory on a Pick as this must be supplied for\nthe pick to work.\n\n\nIf a DataItem is set as Non-Fixed, then this means that it is optional and does\nnot have to be supplied for the process \\ function to work. For example,\nShipping Agent Code is not Fixed in the Shipping function.\n\n\n\n\nIf a DataItem is not fixed, this means that it can be disabled. Disabling it\nwill mean that it will not be prompted for on the Device Client (the value for\nthis DataItem can still be set through code).\n\n\nSessionMgt.GetTransFixedDataItemEnabled\n\n\nGetTransFixedDataItemEnabled (DataItemName : Text) : Boolean\n\n\nGetTransFixedDataItemEnabled\n returns the Boolean value for whether the\nsupplied Fixed DataItem is Enabled.\n\n\nSessionMgt.SetTransFixedDataItem\n\n\nSetTransFixedDataItem(DataItemName : Text;FixedDataItem : Boolean)\n\n\nSetTransFixedDataItem\n sets the Boolean flag \u201cFixed Data Item\u201d for the\nsupplied DataItem to the supplied value.\n\n\nIf this value is set to true then the DataItem becomes optional.\n\n\nSessionMgt.GetLocationCode\n\n\nGetLocationCode() : Code[20]\n\n\nGetLocationCode\n gets the Location Code for the user which made the request.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nLocCode := SessionMgt.GetLocationCode;",

This includes\nthe unique identifier (No.) a brief description of the promotion, along with\ngeneral rules for the promotion, such as: the date range that the promotion will\nbe valid for (if left blank it will apply on all dates); whether it cannot be\ncombined with other promotions (explained below); if it applies to a specific\ncurrency code (blank means LCY \u2013 local currency, taken from the \nGeneral Ledger\nSetup\n); whether conversion from other currencies is allowed (explained below);\nwhether benefit multiplication is allowed and whether or not the promotion is\nenabled.\n\n\nNB\n: If a promotion is not ticked as enabled, it will not take effect, or be\nvisible as a promotion to apply, even if its qualifying criteria are met.\n\n\nLooking in more detail at the General FastTab, there are two fields which when\nselected will change the behaviour of the promotion in certain scenarios. The\nfirst is \nCannot be Combined,\n this field has a range of options which you can\nselect from: Blank, On Document or On Line.\n\n\n\n\nIf the option is left \nBlank,\n then it means that this promotion can be\napplied to a Sales document providing you qualify for it.\n\n\nIf you choose to set it to \nOn Document\n, it means that no other promotion can\nbe applied to a sales document where a promotion already exists, even if some of\nthe lines could qualify for another promotion.\n\n\nThe final option is \nOn Line,\n choosing this option means that if a line\nqualifies for a promotion another promotion cannot be applied to that same line,\neven if that line qualifies for a different promotion.\n\n\nThe second setup field is \nAllow Benefit Multiplication.\n\n\n\n\nSelecting this option determines whether the benefit of the promotion can be\nmultiplied or not. If this tick box has been selected then the benefits will\naccrue automatically, allowing the benefit of the promotion to be multiplied.\n\n\nFor example\n, with a BOGOF (Buy One Get One Free) promotion, if this option\nhas been ticked on the Promotion Card then it will allow multiplication, so that\nif the customer buys three of item X they get another three free.\n\n\nHowever, for some other promotions it may not be practical to have this\nmultiplication effect, \nfor example\n in a \"spend \u00a3100 on X and get \u00a320 off\"\npromotion the company may not want to give a \u00a340 discount if the customer spends\n\u00a3200.

The\n  first could be as part of setup you haven\u2019t run the function \nUpdate\n  Existing Documents,\n which will run through all open or released sales\n  documents and assign them to routes based on the criteria you have setup\n  throughout your addition\u2019s setup pages.\n\n\nIt could also be that the location and date that have been set as filters\n  against the page are filters which have nothing against them. If this is the\n  case, you either need to change the filters on your page or change your\n  default location (warehouse employees\u2019 setup-up) to be correct.\n\n\nNB\n: The Shipment Management route page is filtered by today\u2019s working\n  day and your default location\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI get a warning on sales order that no delivery is scheduled for the order\n    for specified delivery area, agent code and date\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, check the delivery schedule for this delivery area, ensure there is\n  a valid combination setup for the agent and service codes.\u00a0Does the sales\n  orders' shipment date fall on a day within the delivery schedule code? Edit\n  the delivery schedule card to see this information. Double check your sales\n  order line has the correct delivery area, shipping agent and service codes\n  (these values will be defaulted by the setup on the customer).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pick report hasn't printed in the correct order, Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to determine how you, or your users have created the picks, if from\n  shipment management it will use the custom sorting order as specified on the\n  shipment management setup.\u00a0If the pick worksheet has been used, you will\n  need to remember to pick the appropriate sorting method before creating the\n  picks.\u00a0\n\n\nNB\n: You can change the custom s\u200borting method on each pick to what's\n  required for the customer and reprint.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t do collections for Purchase Orders, why are they showing on the\n    Shipment Management Route page?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to check the Shipment Management Setup page, if you do not wish to\n  use Shipment Management for\u200bpurchase order collections ensure the\n  \nCollection Shipping Agent & Collection Agent Service Codes\n are blank.",
