It puts chosen documents (for example Sales Orders) on hold if a\ncustomer has overdue balances or a Sales Order would put them over their Credit\nLimit. You can give them defined User Specific Monetary Authorisation limits to\nenable Sales Orders to be released as required and/or define a specific grace\nperiod for overdue balances. Users can be set as Credit Controllers and be\nassigned to specific accounts. This Addition also has new features designed to\nassist Credit Controllers in the chasing of debts and ensuring timely payment,\nas well as helping with the recording of promised payment dates and ensuring\nthey are followed up on. These To-Do\u2019s can be created manually or automatically\nand are automatically closed if the payment comes in.",

Within User Setup, it is also possible to personalise the Credit\nManagement functionality on a user by user basis within the NAV system, such as\nby setting different Credit Held Release Limits for different users if required.\n\n\nCustom Table Layout:\n This Addition allows filtering by Balance (LCY) if\nneeded, making it easier to understand data. On the Credit Control page, you are\nalso able to filter by the Ageing of Accounts and differentiate the ageing of\ndebts by 30, 60, 90, 120, and 120+ days.\n\n\nInteraction Method:\n You can link the Credit Management Addition to an\nautomated phone dialler system (TAPI) with customers, as well as interact via\nemail to chase up payments.\n\n\nPlaceholders:\n Document Fields can be created in Credit Management, such as\nnew Credit Management Status Codes. These can then be applied when updating\nLedger Entries.\n\n\nCompatibility with Existing Bespoke:\n Logic can be configured to use existing\nbespoke functionality such as the Cash Receipt Journal.\n\n\nNAV Versions:\n Supports NAV 2017 and later",
