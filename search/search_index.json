Options\ninclude: Item, Item Discount Group or Promotion Code.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have chosen your \nBenefit Target Item Type\n, the last bit of setup is\nto determine what you would like to happen to each line, your options include\napplying a \nLine Discount Amount\n or a \nLine Discount %.\n Once completed an\noptional confirmation checkbox, \nPrompt for Confirmation\n, will (if ticked)\nallow the user to manually include or exclude lines.\n\n\n\n\nIf the option \nNew Line\n is selected as the Benefit Target Type it suggests\nthat, if the Sales Document meets the qualifying criteria of the promotion then\na new line will be added to your Sales Document. Choosing this option will\nautomatically populate the Benefit Target Item Type (no drop down to show other\noptions is necessary). You must then choose the \nBenefit Target Item No\n. to\nindicate which item will be added as a new line, as well as \nNew Line\nQuantity\n (how much of the new item you want to add), \nDiscount type\n and\n\nDiscount Amount\n, which are mentioned above.\n\n\nIf you select the option \nCheapest Line\n, this will give the chosen discount %\nor amount on the cheapest line of the sales document. If this option is chosen\nyou must also setup the \nDiscount Type\n and \nDiscount Amount.\n\n\nThe final \nBenefit Target Type\n that you can choose is \nQualifying Lines,\n\nthis gives a specific line discount percentage or amount to all the lines which\nqualify.\n\n\nIf the \nPrompt for Confirmation\n option is ticked then the user is presented\nwith the Promotion Confirmation dialogue box, this gives a choice of which of\nthese qualifying lines to allow the promotion to apply to. By default all the\nlines will be selected.\n\n\n\n\nOne setup field that hasn\u2019t been mentioned yet as part of the Promotion Benefit\nis \nSplit Benefit Across Target Lines\n\n\nIf this option has been left on (this is the default behaviour) it will result\nin the benefit (the discount) being applied to each of the lines which are\ntargeted (ones that qualify under the Qualification Criteria).\n\n\nFor example\n, if the discount is set at \u00a3120 and three lines are identified\nas qualifying to receive discount then each of the three lines will receive a\n\u00a3120 discount, this would give \u00a3360 total discount.\n\n\nIf this is left unticked, it will result in the benefit (the discount) being\nsplit proportionally across the lines which are targeted (ones that qualify\nunder the Qualification Criteria), so if three lines are identified as\nqualifying to receive the \u00a3120 discount then it will be spread proportionally\nover the three lines, giving a total discount of \u00a3120.",

The first thing to do is navigate to \nDocument Delivery Setup\n Page.\n\n\n\n\nOnce on the Document Delivery Setup page you will see the different options\navailable to you.\n\n\nThe first thing to do is click on the \nActions\n tab on the ribbon and select\nthe option \nDefault Configuration.\n\n\n\n\nBy choosing the option \nDefault Configuration\n, it will bring in the main\nDocument Types and the setup behind them, such as Attachments and Fields.\n\n\nNB\n: All the setup behind the different Document Types will be explained\nfurther on in the user guide\n\n\n\n\nOther actions on the tab include: Import, Export or Delete, depending on what\nyour requirement is the appropriate action will occur. The use of \nImport &\nExport Configuration\n is most likely to be used in circumstances where you have\nmore than one company and require the same configuration setup in one company to\nbe replicated in another.\n\n\nWith the Default Configuration imported you still have a few options on the\nDocument Delivery Setup page that you can choose from, manipulating the way in\nwhich you would like the app to work.\n\n\nChoosing a \nDefault Batch Send Behaviour\n from the drop down to be set as\neither \nSingle Attachment\n or \nMultiple Attachment\u2019s\n controls when sending\na document to the customer if attachments (detailed further in the user guide)\nare combined as a single attachment or not.\n\n\nIf you select the option \nProtect Customer Password\n, you are choosing not to\nshow the password given to each customer and vendor that chooses to protect the\ndocuments sent out. This simply masks the password indicating to your user that\na password is there they just don\u2019t know what it is.\n\n\nThe tab on the setup page, around \nTest Mode\n, gives you the chance to test\nsending out different documents through the app without them being sent directly\nto your customers whose documents you are testing on.\n\n\nBoth the above features: Protect Customer Password and Test mode, will be\ndetailed further on in the user guide.",
