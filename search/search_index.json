When you first install one of ours apps with licensing, we will make the following checks: If a license ID is available for this tenant. If there isn\u2019t one in our service, it will create one. The second check that will happen is based on that License ID. It will check if there any license lines. If there are some then it will display them on screen If not, it will create a trial line for each of the apps with licensing. NB : The license will only be activated once users start using the app. To view the license details, use the search to navigate to this Clever Dynamics licensing registration page. On the page you can see which clever dynamics apps hold a form of licensing. How long the license if for, along with visibility of whether it is a Trial License type of an actual License. From this screen you have options such as Activate License , Deactivate License and Refresh CSP. There is no real requirement to come into this screen. The only time you may want to navigate here is to either view which apps you are licensed for. If you are on a Trial license when that will end. Or to Activate License , this will happen when we make any changes to your license and they need to be picked up by the tenant.","title":"Licensing"},{"location":"Clever Associated Items/Appendix/","text":"License Ranges To start using Clever Associated Items in a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central On Premise environment you need to add the Foundation range to your license: Clever Associated Items (9030159 \u2013 9031158)","title":"Appendix"},{"location":"Clever Associated Items/Appendix/#license-ranges","text":"To start using Clever Associated Items in a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central On Premise environment you need to add the Foundation range to your license: Clever Associated Items (9030159 \u2013 9031158)","title":"License Ranges"},{"location":"Clever Associated Items/User Guide/Creating Associated Items/","text":"Once the initial setup has been done, you need to setup the item associations, which is all done against the Item. To get to the Item Card simply navigate using the Search on your role centre to the Items List. Depending on your Role centre you may be able to get to the Items list without needing to use the search. The below screen shot has the role centre of Sales Order Processor . Once on the item list click on the item, which you will be created your Associated Items against. On the Item Card a new action has been added to the ribbon called Associated Items. Clicking on the action Associated Items will open up the setup page for the app to work. On the Associated Items page, you then simply enter the item number for each item to be associated, the system will pull through the description. You can add the item to the list one of two ways. If you know the item code, in the Associated Item No. field type in the item code. If you don\u2019t know the item code click on the drop-down arrow next to the field. You will be presented with a list of your item codes , you can choose from the list which will in turn populate the required field. A default / suggested quantity must then be set for each associated item. Once items are added with suggested quantities and a unit of measure code, the associated items are ready for use. Excluding certain Items In some cases, users will switch on the Automatic suggestions field (highlighted in the setup part of the document) to always make sure that any associated items are being suggested. Naturally this can slow the system down especially when the users only have a few items they want to check the association for. A field on the Item card called Exclude from Suggestions can be enabled per item. This will stop it checking this and other items enabled in the same way for associated items, and in turn stop them from being suggested. To enable the field, navigate to your item card, click on the Associated Items FastTab to expand it, showing you the field, you need to enable.","title":"Creating Associated Items"},{"location":"Clever Associated Items/User Guide/Creating Associated Items/#excluding-certain-items","text":"In some cases, users will switch on the Automatic suggestions field (highlighted in the setup part of the document) to always make sure that any associated items are being suggested.

The associated items are linked with a suggested quantity. When used on a sales order, these extra items can quickly be added in either the suggested quantities or the users chosen quantities. Once added the set of items are linked and the quantities can be increased (or decreased) as a set, so if one table is ordered and the associated eight chairs are added, if the table quantity is revised to two then the chairs (the associated item) can have an extra set of eight added at the same time automatically.","title":"Home"},{"location":"Clever Associated Items/User Guide/Navigating to Setup/","text":"Once installed the Clever Associated Items app needs a small amount of setup in order to work. You need to begin by navigating to the Associated Items Setup, you can do this by using the search on your role centre. Opening this page will later prompt users with notifications. When an item which has associated items has been put on the Sales Line. NB : If you do not open the page, then the notifcation will not appear when items are put onto the Sales Order \u2013 this does not mean that the app does not work, it simply means users wont know if there are associated items that can be added to the order. Once the page has been opened you can start to select and fill in some of the field below. By enabling the field Automatic Suggestions , must be set for suggestions, when set the Suggestions Refresh Period is respected. The Suggestions Refresh Period can be set to update the suggestions if the Suggestions Last Updated (mentioned later on in the user guide) on the item card is less than the refresh period calculation NB : If Automatic Suggestion is enabled this field will become un-editable as there is no requirement to set a period, as it will be running all the time in the background. The final field Item Match Threshold % , determines how many % of the time the items appear together on a sales document to then be suggested. The Clever Associated Items app is only useful if you have set some associations up. This will probably be pretty time consuming, to make it easier we have created a Processing report called Update Item Suggestions. You can perform the update manually. i.e. if the customer does not want set Automatic Suggestions, they can use this report to update item suggestions, the period is respected, a job queue can be setup against the report.","title":"Navigating to Setup"},{"location":"Clever Associated Items/User Guide/Permission Sets/","text":"On install of the Clever Associated Items app a permission set is created.

The final option Continue and leave the associated lines and break the link to this line, will just delete the original item, leaving the associated items. Like all sales lines the associated lines can be deleted if no longer required. If you click Yes to deleting the associated line Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central will check whether the lines are linked due to the association, prompting you to confirm with a second message as to whether you want to delete the selected line.

NB : The quantities will be adjusted based on the ratio you applied when you first added the associated lines, so something to bear in mind when you adjust the quantities. If the Quantity is later reduced, the system will again check and offer to reduce the quantity of the associated items by the multiplier added.

If the item on the line has quantity 2, the suggested item quantity will also be 2. This is based on a 1:1 ratio The Quantity column must be completed, if the numbers are left at zero then when the user chooses Close, nothing will be added to the sales order. When adding the Associated Items, you are not forced to use the recommended quantities; the Suggested Quantity is just a suggestion as stated before, you can set this to any figure. The user simply enters the quantity required in the Quantity column. A useful field when looking to add associated items to your sales order is the Available Qty. field, this looks at the Items Availability and lets you know where this associated item can be added to the Sales Order. You can drill down into the figure on the page and view the item Availability and how that figure has been built up.

Version 2.2.18 Bug Fixes Handle licenses for trials and licenses the same i.e. the definition for AppIsLicensed() should be the same irrespective of the type of license. Version 2.2.17 Bug Fixes 2.2.16 has two fields: \"Company Registration No.\" \"Company Registration No. TMN\" We cannot publish this version to AppSource with a field without the TMN suffix. We will need to remove the first field and ForceSync when we upgrade. Version 2.2.16 Enhancements Use Clever Config Licensing - Use new functions in Clever Config to acquire the license count. Bug Fixes The date is not valid - 0D due date - Handle customer ledger entries with blank due date when calculating overdue days Version 2.2.15 Enhancements Add Company Registration No. to customer card Bug Fixes Handle field rename - Handle field rename for fields which were over 30 char before. Allow for upgrading from previous versions Version 2.2.14 Enhancements Ability to Filter Credit Held List by Credit Controller - Add Credit Controller field to Credit Held list and make it available for users to filter on. Flowfield from Customer table? Field that is populated on validation of Bill-to Customer No?

Customer record cannot be deleted - Customer record cannot be deleted. The bug was fixed in credit management (objects), migrate the bug fix into the app. Reset customer contact no on business relation change - When business relation customer is changed, reset the original customer record and assign the contact no against new customer. Version 2.2.13 Enhancements Renumber into Clever Finance Range - Renumber into 9097029 - 9097128 Rework calling Customer Statement - MS are changing how the customer statement gets called. We need to copy in Clever Credit. Calculating Account Status When Calculating Ledger Entries - Use the routine that recalculates ledger entries to update the customer's account status. The only way that a customer should need to have their status updating without any other trigger (releasing an order, inserting a detailed CLE) is when a ledger entry moves from the not due ageing bucket to the first due ageing bucket. Recalculate Account Status When Grace Period Changes - Changing the grace period might change whether some invoices are considered overdue and therefore change the status of the customer account. Use Events OnBefore/OnAfter Manual Reopen/Release - Replace page action subscriptions with subscriptions to the OnBefore/OnAfter Manual Reopen/Release events which are now available in the sales release codeunit. Remove Service Password Permission - Remove Service Password permission in Clever Credit Setup table - it isn't required anymore and the Service Password table will be removed in a future version.

Bug Fixes NA Build Failing - Reference to VAT Statements - Fix build for NA image - otherwise installation will fail for US and CA tenants. Installing App Fails When CLEs with No. Customer No. are Present - Prevent the app from attempting to retrieve the customer record in this case. The immediate problem is for the v1 app - presumably when the it is attempting to calculate customer stats when the CLE archived data is restored - but this could cause a problem for any version of the app. A CLE without a customer no. is valid e.g. when some data compression has been performed on the db. Version 2.2.11 Enhancements An option has been added to the My Notifications page to optionally disable credit held notifications on sales documents.

Entry TMN Update the actions to get the corresponding Customer entry first, and pass this to DD Version 2.2.10 Bug Fixes Update the Account Status when changing the due date on the customer ledger entry, therefore if the dates are changed so an invoice is no longer overdue the status on the customer card is updated. When an order has been released from credit held you can amend the order and users can re-release if the order value is below the original amount, however adding a line discount of 100% or an order value of zero means the order is credit held again. This has been changed so that zero value orders do not go through the credit hold process again and can be re-released. Version 2.2.9 Enhancements Update Account Status on Sales Order Deletion - Customer account status should be recalculated when a sales order is deleted e.g. if the order took them over their credit limit and deleting that order takes them back under again.

Enforce Licensed No. of Credit Controllers - Licensing by the number of credit controllers seems a better way to manage a count of licenses for our app. Event Subscribers - easier to read and more concise if the code was in the extension objects themselves (or calls from the extension objects to functions in codeunits, where appropriate). Code Analysis - a tidy up to stop the repository throwing up warnings from the code analysis. UI/UX Changes - Changes to the UI, promoted actions, captions etc. particularly around the Credit Held List and Manage Credit Status Bug Fixes Overflow Error Showing on Chart - Overflow error decimal to integer attempting to drilldown on average days to pay. License details not visible - No way to get to licence details page from Clever Credit page.

Also, show the To-Do Entry No. as the first column on the To-Do list page. Descriptions on Interactions - Add a description field to the interaction card - which should be editable. This description should carry through to the to-do when automatically creating a to-do because a next interaction date has been entered. If the description field is blank when the Next Interaction Date is populated, populate the description with the text \"Follow up call from %1\" where %1 is the date of this interaction. Description of To-Do\u2019s Created from Promised Payment Date - When we automatically create a to-do by entering a promised payment date on a customer ledger entry, we should populate the description of that to-do with \"Check promised payment has been received.\" Bug Fixes Credit Controller Code from User ID \u2013 when creating the Credit Control code ee take the first 10 characters and convert it to be the Code, if there\u2019s more than one we remove the last character and add a number. After checking that a credit controller exists with the same code, copy the User ID and then make it 2 characters shorter. Version 1.0.2 Enhancements License Details Page - Create new page to display the status of the licence, when the trial expires and give the option to set a new date for the expiry of the trial. Create a new codeunit that will be responsible for checking the status of the licence when certain actions are performed in the product, pop notifications to warn that the trial is about to expire etc. Bug Fixes Assigning Customers to Credit Controller \u2013 if you cancel the lookup dialog box without assigning any customers to the credit controller, all the customers in your customer list are assigned to the credit controller. Version 1.0.1 Enhancements Assign Customers Action on Credit Controller List - Add a new action to the Credit Controller List page. Show the Customer List (filtered to customers who have a blank Credit Controller). If the OK button is used to close the page iterate through the selected customers and set the Credit Controller code on each of them. Rework Select Column on Clever Credit Interaction - The current UX works nicely on the Windows client, but not on the web client. Print Selected Invoices from Clever Credit Interaction Screen - Add action to print selected invoices from the Make Phone Call screen. This will allow the user to download a PDF of the invoices and send to the customer while they are on the phone to them. Days to Pay Chart - Add a new chart to the Clever Credit Statistics page to show the trend of a customer's payments over time. Plot the number of days to pay each invoice against time as a line chart. This will allow the user to see at a glance the trend of customer payments over time. View Credit Control Interactions from CLEs (Customer Ledger Entries) - From the CLEs page the user can see invoices on the account. Add a FactBox so that they can see any interactions that have been made with the customer where this invoice has been discussed.

If the user, then tries to open the Clever Credit Page it errors. Do Not Calculate Days to Pay for Non-Invoice Cust. Ledger Entries- They are being calculated making the Clever credit statistics entries hard to read.

Trying to find out who needs to chase what. No, individual credit controller dashboards help each of your team to keep on top of their specific accounts and outstanding balances. Follow up calls/to-dos are automatically diarised and visible in each team members dashboards to remind them when to chase promised payments. Can I set certain customers to be exempt from the credit rules? Yes, there is a Clever Credit FastTab on the customer card, which allows you to set different rules for individual customers. Can all users see the documents that are on Credit hold? There are many ways in which a user can see a document which is on credit held. The first place that it can be seen is on the Sales Document header itself. There is a field called Order Status , which indicates the state of the document. Another area in which users can go to find out which documents are on hold is through the Credit Held List. Doing this they will be able to see all Sales Documents being held. They can also navigate to the Credit Held List via the Manage Status button on the Sales document ribbon. Doing it this way will filter the credit held list to the sales document in which they have navigated from. Once a to-do has been completed how do I remove it? You don\u2019t need to deal with the manual task of completing to - do\u2019s once a process has been completed i.e. a cash receipt journal has been posted against a customer ledger entry in dispute the to do will disappear as the task has been completed and no further action is required. Doesn\u2019t holding the document slow the sales process down? At first it may seem that way, but over time with the right credit rules in place it will reduce the customers risk of late payments in the first place that would have put them on hold. We use deal with different currency and use exchange rates will clever credit work for us? Yes, but be aware of currency fluctuations. These will factor into how many times a document needs to be credit held. If a Sales Order is being Credit Held unexpectedly, particularly after it has already been Credit Released once, it may be related to a currency fluctuation. When releasing/shipping & invoicing an error pops up that the order needs to be credit held again, which is correct as the value has increased due to the exchange rate. Does your App integrate with other systems? Integration to Office365 and Skype for Business means actioning follow-up calls or emails to chase for payment are just a click away. Can a Sales document be held even after its been credit released? When a document is credit held it sits in the Credit Held list once released, the order moves to the Credit Released list and the sales headers status changes to credit released. From the Credit released list users can then highlight the document and click on the Hold button. This process means that you don\u2019t have to reopen or modify the sales document in any way to force it back through the credit held process. I am looking at the Clever To-Do\u2019s and can see a To-do for a customer that is not visible in the Clever Credit screen, how is this possible? This is most likely because the Clever Credit has been filtered to a specific credit controller. It could be that the customer is against a different credit controller. NB : Removing the filter from eth page won\u2019t clear the filter completely by default the screen will filter to the default credit controller if one has been set in the Clever Credit Setup page. The Clever Credit Statics box doesn\u2019t show a figure in the No. of To-Dos for a customer even though I know there is one from them. Only open To-Dos will show in here, if you click on the figure and clear the filter applied to the field Open the To-do(s) will most likely appear. One of my clients is going to be using Clever Credit, and their credit control office has a setup with a credit controller that runs the office, with several other credit controllers reporting to her. On the Clever Credit Page there is an Options button. If you click on that it gives you a couple of extra filters to the page. One of them includes the Credit Controller filter. The supervisor can filter the list to which ever credit controller customers they need to look at, and the list will be filtered based on which customers have been assigned to them. As well as assigning credit controllers to customers, she needs to be able to review the performance of the individual credit controllers, so in effect look at the \u2018clever credit\u2019 page as if she was another credit controller. How can this be achieved? You should note that when you log in (if you are credit controller) and have customers assigned to you the list will be automatically filtered on opening the page. If you are a credit controller and don\u2019t have any customers, then the list will show all customers. This means that if someone goes on leave then the list can be filtered so show their customers for someone else to manage. On the Clever Credit Screen, I have noticed that there are different colors and fonts against some of the balances. What do they mean?

The prompts are identified as Notifications along the top of your role centre. By clicking on the link Open Setup on the notification, it will open the Clever Credit -- Assisted Setup page. Using the Assisted Setup provides you with a step by step guide of everything you need to setup to successfully run the Clever Credit App. If you accidently close the notification without going through the setup, don\u2019t panic! there is another way. Simply click through the following menu structure Setup & Extensions Assisted Setup. From the list choose to run Set up Clever Credit , by clicking on the Start setup option. Once you have got past the welcome message you will be presented with a series of setup prompts. Selecting Yes (default option) for Credit Hold Documents means that if a customer has an overdue balance or is over their credit limit, their documents are put on hold. These documents will be visible on the Credit Held List page and must be released by a credit controller with a sufficient release limit. NB : You have the option to select No . If you choose not to credit hold any documents, you will not be prompted to select which documents you would like to credit hold (next prompt in the series). NB: The Default Credit Controller at this stage does not need to be populated, it can be populated later or left completely blank. From this page you can also run a second Assisted Setup function called Set up a new Credit Controller. Details of this can be found later in the user guide. Next you come to setting up the Status Codes, these can be created to send reminders to users (internally) regarding what action, has been or needs to be taken for those accounts with overdue balances. These codes will depend on business processes and as many, or as few as you require, can be added here as you wish. The Status Codes can also be found on the Clever Credit Status List, where again, you can make the necessary changes based on your business requirements.

Once a field number is chosen, the system will complete the field name, and we can then choose the Type for how we wish to validate the contents of that field. The types of rules that can be created are: Must Equal - the specified field must match the value that is entered in the Value column. Must match the filter - the specified field must have a value that falls within the filter specified in the Value column. The filter expression must match the type of data that is stored in the field specified. For example, use \\<>'' (different to blank) to indicate that the field must have a value; Use >0 to indicate that a numeric field must have a value greater than zero. Must be a certain length - the specified field must have a value that contains the number of characters set in the Value column. A user-friendly error message is then entered.

Another app of ours called Clever Config and PrintNode Integration will be installed at the same time. NB: You should not uninstall Clever config if you plan on using the Clever Document Delivery App. Unlike some of our other apps Clever Document Delivery requires all your setup to be done manually, which consists of you going into each of the setup pages (highlighted throughout the user guide) and creating the required business setup. We do help a little by providing you with the option to import our Default Configuration Below we will explain the requirements for manually setting up the app and how importing the default configuration will save you time in getting the app ready for use. The first thing to do is navigate to Document Delivery Setup Page. Once on the Document Delivery Setup page you will see the different options available to you. The first thing to do is click on the Actions tab on the ribbon and select the option Default Configuration. By choosing the option Default Configuration , it will bring in the main Document Types and the setup behind them, such as Attachments and Fields. NB : All the setup behind the different Document Types will be explained further on in the user guide Other actions on the tab include: Import, Export or Delete, depending on what your requirement is the appropriate action will occur. The use of Import & Export Configuration is most likely to be used in circumstances where you have more than one company and require the same configuration setup in one company to be replicated in another. With the Default Configuration imported you still have a few options on the Document Delivery Setup page that you can choose from, manipulating the way in which you would like the app to work. Choosing a Default Batch Send Behaviour from the drop down to be set as either Single Attachment or Multiple Attachment\u2019s controls when sending a document to the customer if attachments (detailed further in the user guide) are combined as a single attachment or not. If you select the option Protect Customer Password , you are choosing not to show the password given to each customer and vendor that chooses to protect the documents sent out. This simply masks the password indicating to your user that a password is there they just don\u2019t know what it is. The Printing FastTab , has one field called Print Handler , this field will be pre-populated based on which printing options you have setup and what your client allows you to use. The tab on the setup page, around Test Mode , gives you the chance to test sending out different documents through the app without them being sent directly to your customers whose documents you are testing on. Both the above features: Protect Customer Password and Test mode, will be detailed further on in the user guide.","title":"Default Configuration"},{"location":"Clever Document Delivery/User Guide/Document Delivery Setup/Password Protection/","text":"Another setup feature that you may want to take advantage of is Document Delivery Password .

This can then be hidden to users completely by using the setting mentioned in the Document Delivery Setup page; Protect Customer Password The use of a password is set on a Document Type basis and the Default Configuration adds the password feature to the Fields FastTab of each Document Type. This can be left on for some Document Types and removed for others, the users have full control. Also, the password can be removed from Customer Card page or Vendor Card page at any time to stop using passwords, without needing to change the setup.

The API Key is something that you will need to populate, this will be given to you when you register with PrintNode Services. The API Description is simply some descriptive text relating to the setup. At this point you may choose to Test the connection, making sure that the API Key you populated is correct and that you can use the services provided. To do this select the button Test Connection on the Action tab. If successful, the following message will show.

It is within this screen that you will be able to attach the report you plan on sending out to that customer or vendor, later in the user guide we will talk about attaching attachments alongside or combined with reports. The Attachment Type at this stage should be set to Report . Once you have chosen your report you will notice both the Attachment Name and the Batch Attachment Name will automatically populate with text written in the Report Name field. These can be changed (not the report name field) but the attachment & batch attachment name fields. Changing these fields will change the description of the attachment sent out to your recipients. Like the above scenario the app queries whether to use the Subject or the Batch subject, it will also query when to use the Attachment Name (single records) or Batch Attachment Name (Grouped or queued records). The option to Store Documents should be used with caution and only really used on posted documents. Storing a document holds a record, at that point in time of how the document was, if you were to change that document and resend the amended version out again, the app will first look to the Stored Documents list, and if it finds a match it will resend the orginal document out again. In an ever-changing environment of sales order processing it would not work to Store the document records. Retention Period defines the period that the document should be kept in the Document Store for. The \u201cStore Until\u201d field on the Document Store table will be populated when the report is created. Each attachment can be set as a Watermark or Merge (added as additional pages to the back) or added as a separate attachment to the email. Attachments can be set to apply to only prints or only emails fro example only add the T&C\u2019s attachment when emailing, not printing. This is set in the field File Processing Type Against the attachments there are several actions which can alter an attachment and the way it is presented as part of that document type. New Line and Delete Line will either allow you to create a new attachment record against the document type or delete an attachment line you are no longer using. Doc. Type Attachment Card will open a detailed attachment card based on the attachment record you have highlighted to view. The Doc. Type Attachment Card will be explained further on in the user guide in more detail. Clicking on option Edit Request Page will open the reports request page, this is a set of filter options to run that report. For example, running the request page for Posted Sales Invoices you may what to filter out all invoices every time the document type is run (PSI) to not include Customers with location White. NB : If not done then the first time you process a record for a document type which hasn\u2019t had the request page flagged as run, then it will prompt you to set those options or filters as part of the process before it can send the document out. After the first time it will keep those settings and not ask again. If at any point you need to modify the request page the action Clear Request Page, will remove all report filters for that document type and unflag the attachment line as having no request page. Choosing the action Options allows you to set a calculation against any of the date fields on the attachments request page. NB: In order for the date fields to show on the Options page you must Edit Request Page first and this will populate the fields. This is mainly used on the Statement (STMNT) Document Type. You set the calculations against the fields StartDate and End Date so that every month when the statement is run it is running for the correct date criteria. NB: If the calculations weren\u2019t set in here, you would need to make sure that every month a user would need to go into this document type and change the request page. If they didn\u2019t the statements would be set out using the previous months date range. In order to automatically produce statements for the current month you can use the calculation formulas as shown below, this will return statements for the first to the last day of the current month. To change the order in which attachments are displayed on your emails being sent out use the Move Up or Move Down actions.","title":"Attachments FastTab"},{"location":"Clever Document Delivery/User Guide/Document Types/Delivery FastTab/","text":"The next section of the document type is the Delivery FastTab this contains settings that will be used when creating emails from this document type. The Subject relates to the subject of the email received by the recipient(s), this will be picked up when choosing individual records to send out. If multiple records have been selected and then grouped it will use the Batch Subject field as the subject of the email received by the recipient(s). It is only when the option Queue Email , (explained in more detail further on in the user guide) is used that the information in the Sender Name and Sender Address will be used. NB : The Batch Subject will also be used when choosing to Queue the emails rather than send them straight away. If you are using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, you must fill in the Sender Address regardless of whether you are using Send Email or Queue Email as the app no longer goes through Outlook. NB : Not populating it will cause an error visible in the Document Delivery Log. The other side of the FastTab relates to the printing of documents. Previously in the user guide we setup some Print Node fields allowing us to test whether we could print documents through Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. The settings in here allow you to determine if a document type should be printed or not. The Print field is a drop-down field allowing you to choose when and if you want the document type to print. Leaving the field Blank indicates that the document type does not need to be printed and only emailed to customers. If you choose When No Recipient , then you need to make sure you fill in the field Printer Name. By choosing when no recipient, you are telling the application that if an email address hasn\u2019t been found for a customer/vendor for a particular document type then print the document to a dedicated printer (indicated in the Printer name field). If you choose the final option Always , you are saying that regardless of whether there is an email to send the document type out to or not, you still want the document printing. This means in some cases only a printout of the document type will be done for all records selected. In other cases, both an email will be sent to the customer/vendor as well as printout being done. When populating the Printer Name field you ca either type in the printer name (if know) or use the assist next to the field to choose from the list of printers NB : Printer Tray is an optional field to populate you don\u2019t need to go to that level of detail unless you want your document printing from a certain printer tray in your printer.","title":"Delivery FastTab"},{"location":"Clever Document Delivery/User Guide/Document Types/Fields FastTab/","text":"The final FastTab on the Document type is the Fields FastTab. While some of the information on the document type may be static e.g. the sender address for the document type may not change for each document, much of the information will need to change with each record that is sent out. The Detail Type column tells the app that a document field holds data for a purpose. These are: To \u2013 the value of the field will be used as a to address of the email Cc \u2013 the value of the field will be used as a Cc address of the email Bcc \u2013 the value of the field will be used as a Bcc address of the email Attachment \u2013 the value of the field is the path to a file that should be included as an attachment on the email. The document type should include at least one document field with detail type of To . The other details types are optional. More than one document field can have the same detail type. The values of the fields will be combined when the email is created i.e. all To, Cc and Bcc recipients will appear on the email. In addition, all Attachment type fields will be included on the email. A document field will usually hold a single value (as per above) but it is possible to allow the document field to hold multiple values, simply by selecting the option Allow Multiple This functionality can be used to define multiple email recipients or multiple attachments on emails. The next field along is the No. of Lines field. Each document field has one or more Field Lines to define where the value of the field is taken from. Fields can take their value from: A field in the Primary Table i.e. the record that has been submitted to the document delivery system. A field in a Linked Table (see further on in the user guide), a field in a secondary table that is \u2018linked\u2019 to the primary table e.g. determining the To Address from the Customer record that is linked to a Sales Invoice Header record. A Static Value , some text that is entered directly into the Document Field Line. Each document field can have multiple document field lines i.e. multiple sources that the value of the field might come from. To get to these source click on the field. Above is an example of how the To Address of the Sales Order Document is evaluated: From top to bottom the lines are: The Value field from the DD Custom Value table (see further on in the User Guide) The First Name field from the Contact defined by the Sell-to Contact No. of the document The Name field from the Customer record If there is no corresponding DD Custom Value, or if its value is blank the system will take the First Name from the Contact table. If that field is blank e.g. because the Sell-to Contact No. is not defined on the document, then the Name field will be taken from the Customer record. Lastly, if that field is also blank the static text of \u2018Customer\u2019 will be taken. The final field on this FastTab is the Display Order. This is used to set a numbered order in which the fields are shown on the \u201cEdit \u2013 Report Selection\u201d page when sending a batch of records. If a negative number is set, then that field will not be displayed in the Values portion of the page, but its details will still be used. This is useful for forcing settings that can\u2019t be modified by the users.","title":"Fields FastTab"},{"location":"Clever Document Delivery/User Guide/Document Types/General FastTab/","text":"Each Document type is given a unique Code , this code can be found in multiple locations within Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. The code is also given a Description , so you know what type of document you are going to be running. The Primary Table No. Filter field tells the system which record(s) this document type should be used with. For example, a Sales Order Confirmation document type should use table 36 (Sales Order Header), while a remittance advice document type to be printed from the Payment Journal page should use table 81 (Gen. Journal Line). In addition, the Primary Table Document Type should be set when using table 36 (Sales Header) or 38 (Purchase Header). For example, sales quotes and sales order confirmations (both of which use table 36) it will allow you to choose a separate primary table document type. NB : If you try to set the Primary Table Document Type when you are not using table 36 or 38 then it will error. The Group by Field No . allows you to set a grouping at document type level, allowing you to highlight multiple records and for the app to determine based on your setup how the records should be sent out. For example, if you group by Sell-to Customer No . then all records highlighted to be sent will be grouped by this field. This means that your customers will not receive multiple emails for individual records, instead they will receive potentially one email with multiple records attached. When you click on the assist next to the field you are given all the fields that you can choose from to Group by, these are fields based on your Primary Table No. Filter The Group Field Name simply shows the name of the field you have chosen to group by.

Other options available include: Download - enabling you to download any documents within this FactBox by clicking the icon, which will open a pop-out window allowing you to open or save the document. Or you can also remove documents from there if no longer needed by clicking the Remove icon.","title":"Doc.Links File Drop FactBox"},{"location":"Clever Document Links/User Guide/Document Attributes/","text":"Trying to find a record which you have linked to a specific document, can become a bit of chore, especially as the Linked Document page grows over time. Our app offers Document Attributes which help in filtering that linked documents page and minimise the list that you need to go through. To begin with you need to navigate to the Document Attributes page, you can do this using the search action on the role centre. Once on the page start to create your attributes, simply click on the New button and begin by giving your attribute a unique Code along with a Name (something meaningful to describe the code you have just given your attribute). The next step is to then create the values related to that attribute, to do this click on the Actions ribbon and click on the Values function. In the attribute values screen you will start to build up a list of values associated with the attribute you created. These are the filters that will be applied to the records to help you with filtering. Simply populate the field Value with a unique identifier. Once complete you can start to link the attributes to your linked documents. To link all your setup together navigate back to the Linked Documents Page. Once on the page highlight a record in the list and click on the Attributes button found on the Action tab. In the Linked Document Attributes Page, you will start to link Attributes and Attribute Values to the document you highlighted in the previous screen. Click on the new button and either type or choose from the drop down your Attribute Code . By selecting the attribute code, the list for Attribute Values to select from will be filtered to that attribute code. Now when you click on the record in the Linked documents Page the attributes you applied to that record are now visible in the details of the FactBox. Applying attributes to the linked documents now means that actions such as Filter By Attributes can be used to now filter the number of records you see on the page. NB : Clear Attributes Filter simply removes the filter you applied to the page showing you all the records again. Against each record there is a FactBox called Doc. Links File Drop, mentioned previously in the user guide. On there is a field called No. of Attributes. NB : By default, this field is hidden. You can add it by personalizing the page if you require. Once visible you can then click into the no field to see clearly not only how many attributes have been applied to that document, but also which ones.","title":"Document Attributes"},{"location":"Clever Document Links/User Guide/Document Links Setup/","text":"Like some of our other apps Clever Document Links requires a dependency to be installed. Another app of ours called Clever Config will be installed at the same time. NB: You should not Uninstall Clever config if you plan on using the Clever Documents Links App. Below we will explain the requirements for setting up the app and how importing the default configuration will save you time in getting the app ready for use. The first thing to do is navigate to the Document Links Setup Page. Once on the Document Links Setup page you will see the different options available to you. The first thing to do is click on the Actions tab on the ribbon and select the option Get Default Configuration. By running the Get Default Configuration action, a set of commonly used Document Types and the corresponding Search Fields are populated into your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central environment. Further on in the user guide you will find more information on Document Types and Search Fields. Other actions on the tab include Test SharePoint Connection , which is only available when you choose to store your document s in SharePoint and Update Archive Location. Each linked document within Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central has details of where it is stored individually. In cases where you would like to move the documents and need to update the file path location for document storage on the setup page you will need to run the Action Update Archive Location once you have manually moved all of the documents to the new location. This can be used in cases where you are moving from database to a network storage option, or moving to a different SharePoint Site/Folder. After running the Get Default Configuration action the next bit of setup you need to do is determine where you want to store your documents. If you drop down on the field File Storage you have two options. The Database option will store documents within your database. Clicking the SharePoint option in File Storage field will bring up a new FastTab called SharePoint Settings , to set up this service. You may want to run Test SharePoint Connection once the fields have been filled in using the button in the Actions ribbon, to make sure your connection is correct. The OCR Settings FastTab allows you to input an OCR Service User and Password. Populating these fields will enable Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central to read barcodes and find a record to match them within the database. NB : You will need to purchase the OCR Service separately. Determining SharePoint Settings The correct SharePoint settings cannot necessarily be determined from the URL at which you access the Document Library. Follow these steps to find the correct URL for the Site and the Document Library: Site Navigate to the Home page of the SharePoint site Click \u201cSite information\u201d from the gear icon in the top right-hand corner Click \u201cView all site settings\u201d from the pane that opens Click \u201cTitle, description and logo\u201d Copy the URL from the bottom of that page to the SharePoint Site field on the Document Links Setup page Document Library Navigate to the Document Library that you are going to archive documents to Click \u201cLibrary Settings\u201d from the gear icon in the top right-hand corner Copy the \u201cName\u201d from the top of the page into the Library Name field on the Document Links Setup page","title":"Document Links Setup"},{"location":"Clever Document Links/User Guide/Document Links Setup/#determining-sharepoint-settings","text":"The correct SharePoint settings cannot necessarily be determined from the URL at which you access the Document Library.

You can do this via the Search from your Role Centre. The Pending Inbound Documents screen is where you can view files that have not yet been accepted into Dynamics 365 Business Central. From this screen there are several actions that can be run to process your Inbound Documents. If you choose to Accept your inbound document you must highlight the record or records. If any records have failed to be accepted they will be flagged as having a Processing Error . Failed inbound documents will remain in the Pending Inbound Documents screen until they have either been rejected or the error rectified. Any records that have passed all validation will be visible on the Accepted Inbound Document screen NB : Inbound Documents can also be flagged as having a Processing Error before they have been accepted based on the field mappings. Other options include Reject , where instead of accepting an inbound document from a trading partner you may want to reject the document. If this is the case the record will disappear from your current list, instead creating an entry on the Rejected Inbound Documents page. Clicking on the Show Error action will show you the reason why the inbound document has a processing error against it. If multiple documents are coming through from the same trading partner you can consolidate them into one huge document, treating the inbound document as one Sales Document on creation rather than several smaller ones. If you do click on the Consolidate Documents action you must then decide which document you want the lines to be consolidated into. Once selected you will see how instead of two records on the screen there is only one record in the inbound documents screen containing the lines from both documents. NB : Please check with your trading partner if you can use this functionality as some trading partners need their invoices to be specific in that way that they sent the order. As mentioned before if a file has failed it will be flagged as having a processing error, remaining in the Inbound Documents screen waiting for an action to be carried out on it. Most processing errors tend to be around missing data, data which you can easily fix before reprocessing the document. If a file has failed, the first thing to do is view the processing error. Explained earlier you can click on the Show Error action on the page and a pop up will appear on the box detailing the failure. The other option is to click into the record, opening the document that you are going to be accepting. On the document header you can see the error in a field labelled Error Text. With the error identified you can navigate to the correct pages to populate the correct Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business central pages with the missing data. You can use the search to get to the pages you require, or you can use the EDI action on the Pending Inbound Document to quickly get to the pages you need to. After making the changes to your data you can click on the Validate action Clever EDI will check the message to ensure it meets the criteria for the validation method set on the document agreement. If the error is still present upon validating it will remain in the log, as still having a Processing Error . If it meets all the criteria the Inbound Document will not be flagged as having a processing error and ready to be accepted. Other actions on the page include being able to Accept or Reject the Inbound Document. By clicking on the Additional Data option, you can view other data that has been captured in the Inbound Document ( Additional Data ), or tracking information relating to lot or serial tracking ( Tracking ). There is also an Additional Data button at line level, allowing you to see any further information captured at line level which is different to the Inbound document\u2019s header level.","title":"Pending Inbound Documents"},{"location":"Clever EDI/User Guide/Permission Sets EDI/","text":"The Clever EDI app install will create two permission sets, one is Clever EDI and the other is for the dependency app Inbound Documents.

Use the Search on your role centre to navigate to any of these pages. MES Activity Log The MES Activity Log shows all Activity undertaken by Operators at a high-level, meaning that for example whilst it will show that a user has selected the Components screen it will not show the item number nor the quantity of the component that has been output. What the Activity Log is useful for is looking at error messages and how long operators are spending within each screen. Below is a breakdown of each field in the MES Activity Log: Entry Number \u2013 The number of the entry of the activity created. Device ID \u2013 Which device was being used by the operator that created the entry. Activity Code \u2013 Which screen or SubForm the operator was in at the time of the activity.

Activity Date/Time \u2013 The time and date at which the action was performed. Error/Error Message \u2013 This will show if the operator came across an error during the Production Order, this may be due to NAV setup for if the Operator has made a mistake. The Error message field will also show when Production Orders are completed, these will not have a tick within the Error field. Next Activity \u2013 This will show the next action performed by the Operator.

The machine centres themselves have an MES FastTab to depict how in the portal you may want each machine centre to function. To get to your machine Centres click on the Search and navigate to Machine Centers Once on the Machine Centre list highlight any of the machines centres and click into it to open up the Machine Center Card at the bottom of the screen you will see a FastTab called MES. On the FastTab there are several fields which you can enabled and change depending on how you would like that Machine to work. You can choose to change the setting Prod Order Presentation. During the initial setup of the device, to begin the output process the user will be presented with a list of routing lines, which in turn identifies the production orders those routing lines belong to. By default, this field is set to Prompt (per machine centre) which means the operator will be presented with a list of routing lines, through production orders which need to be completed. If you change the machine centre to be Automatic , then the operator will simply be presented with the next routing line not completed for the next production order in the list, not giving them the option to choose specifically which Production Order (routing line) they are going to be working on. Like the previous field the Process Type can be changed from the default Single Line to All Lines when an operator wants to work on multiple routing lines for the same operation within one production order . For example, several items might be loaded into an oven and be worked on simultaneously. In this scenario, the SFDC operator doesn't want to have to select each prod. order line in isolation or start and stop the machine. This option can only be ticked when the Machine Centre is set to process Multiple Lines. When this option is ticked the Components, subpage will appear slightly differently. Retrieve the components for all of the prod. order lines that are being worked on but only show each unique item/variant code once. Total the expected quantity (base) from all lines. When the components are posted, instead of posting item journal lines as usual, the consumption should be recorded in the above table. Split \u2013 Post Consolidate Components - Option to split and post the entries currently being stored in the SFDC Consumptions Entry table. The Qty. to Post on a \"Consolidate Components\" screen should be split proportional between the prod. order lines. Show in SFDC Only show machine centres where this is ticked in SFDC. Confirm Operator on Output - Present the user with a Subform of tiles of the operators currently assigned to the prod. order routing line. Ask them to select the (one) operator who has worked on the output. Show Prod Order from Work Ctr- by setting this to an option other than Default it will overwrite whether you have this option switched on or not per machine centre. The final setting is Use Production Groups , this can be a global setting done in SFDC or at machine Centre level. The idea behind Production groups is that an operator may want to work on multiple routing lines from multiple production orders on one machine centre. We don\u2019t do any further setup as part of the product other than this tick box or the Portal Framework Data Type ( Prod_Group ) instead a developer would need to tie into the events we supply to make this work. First determining the Prod Groups and then the routing lines belonging to those groups.

MES operators can be setup two different ways, , the first to post their time and cost against a given machine centre the second is simply to provide a list of operators where no costs will be posted to for them and only applied to the capacity ledger entries (and device logs) to say this operator worked on this machine centre. To do this you first need to navigate to the MES Operators Page, do this by using the Search function. Once on the page, you will need to start populating the necessary fields. The Code is a unique identifier for each operator created. The Name is the operators name. The name shown here will be visible on the device during the production process. The next field is optional by linking an operator to a machine centre is to allow for costs and time to be posted against the routing line as well as the machines cost and time (the one they selected on the device). Creating separate ledger entries. If you do decide to populate the Machine Centre No field, you need to make sure that in your MES Setup page that Post Operator Time/Cost is enabled. NB : Ticking this option requires an operator to be linked to a machine centre, if for any reason it is missed otherwise it will error in the device when trying to post capacity ledger entries. You typically create the operator as a new machine centre, to do this click on the New option instead of selecting a machine centre already there. By clicking on the New option, it will open up a blank Machine Centre Card , which you will need to fill in. Make sure to especially populate the Unit Cost field, this is to determine the cost of the machine once the production line has been completed. You will notice there is an MES FastTab on the page. This will be detailed later on in the User Guide, however at this point you do need to go into that FastTab and make sure Show in MES is not enabled. This is to make sure you don\u2019t see this Machine Centre on the device. The next field along is the Unit of Measure Code is the unit of measure that will appear against the capacity ledger entry is also used in the calculations of the costs operator if you choose to Post Operator Time/Costs. The final field is the Unit Cost . This is the Unit cost of the operator. Access Codes With the operators now, setup there are a couple of other options you can apply to the operators the first is giving them an Access Code .

The order in which you want the operators to be prompted can be moved about. Mentioned previously in the Portal Framework section of the document users can set these up per device rather than use the global settings in here. You can choose to enable Show Ops with No Qty to Start . If enabled this will determine whether only operations which have a Qty. Available to Start Base (found on the routing line) are shown. This will only work for routing lines which are manual flushing, this is setup on the routing card against the field Flushing Method (forward and backward flushing wouldn\u2019t usually go through MES) On your Released Production Order, you will have a Quantity on header. This quantity will flush through to the first routing line (the first operation required to complete the finished item) visible in the field Qty. Available to Start Base. As you complete your first operation and output the quantity that outputted quantity will then be visible on the next routing line populating the field Qty. Available to Start Base. Setting the flag Show Ops with No Qty to Start means that users can see operation lines which have no Qty. Available to Start Base, most likely down to the previous operation not being completed with no output generated to start the next operation Another option you can select is to Show Prod Order from Work Ctr .

Within the device it means that users can see the button and then then determine how much of the routing line they would like to scrap. On the device screens once enabled operators will be able to select the scrap option. NB : Posting the scrap does not adjust the Quantity Remaining to output on the routing line, scarp is a separate posting. Instead once you click OK on the scrap screen it will post a Capacity Ledger Entry against the production order updating the field Scrap Quantity on the line . If you are planning on using scrap, make sure to setup Scrap Codes this is a standard manufacturing component of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Premium and can be found using the search. The scrap code selected by the operator during the scrap process can be seen in the MES Device Log, which we will detail later in the user guide. NB : The Default Configuration will import some Scrap codes; however, you may want to go into that page and add your own business specific ones. If you enable the flag to Allow by Products , indicates that you might not want to scrap a component but instead create a by-product of it, selecting this option shows the button on the device in the navigation pane (just like scrap).

Ensure that the Account Code is populated, if not, one needs to be selected at this point. If one isn\u2019t selected, Payment Gateway will prompt the use to enter one before continuing.

Therefore, my sales type is set to All Customers, and the criteria type is Minimum Amount at \u00a3200. Also enter the specific item discount group you would like to associate with the benefit. This will target all qualifying lines on the order for items within item discount group A and will generate a line discount of 10% when the promotion is applied to the order. Code5: When you buy a certain Quantity Customers within price group B have promotion codes for a further discount when purchasing a minimum quantity of an item. In this instance you will be targeting a customer price group and offering a further discount when they purchase a minimum quantity of an item. To do this firstly create a promotion code group and create a list of sequential codes which you can send out to all customers within customer price group B. (see Using Promotions codes on how to set these up). These codes can then be used to obtain a 5% discount when the customer purchases a minimum quantity of 5 items. As per the setup above you select the sales type and customer price group I want to aim the promotion at. Granting the promotion benefit depends on the order lines meeting the qualification criteria which in this example must be a line for item 1000 at a minimum quantity of 5 and requires a promotion code from promotion group 5% to be applied.

Choosing the Benefit Target Type to be All Lines , implies that you want the promotion benefit to affect all lines on the Sales Document. If this option is selected, you should then choose the Benefit Target Item Type, indicating specifically what type of line you want the benefit to be applied to. Options include: Item, Item Discount Group or Promotion Code. Once you have chosen your Benefit Target Item Type , the last bit of setup is to determine what you would like to happen to each line, your options include applying a Line Discount Amount or a Line Discount %. Once completed an optional confirmation checkbox, Prompt for Confirmation , will (if ticked) allow the user to manually include or exclude lines. If the option New Line is selected as the Benefit Target Type it suggests that, if the Sales Document meets the qualifying criteria of the promotion then a new line will be added to your Sales Document. Choosing this option will automatically populate the Benefit Target Item Type (no drop down to show other options is necessary). You must then choose the Benefit Target Item No . to indicate which item will be added as a new line, as well as New Line Quantity (how much of the new item you want to add), Discount type and Discount Amount , which are mentioned above. If you select the option Cheapest Line , this will give the chosen discount % or amount on the cheapest line of the sales document. If this option is chosen you must also setup the Discount Type and Discount Amount. NB : When looking at the Cheapest Line, it is looking at the Sales Line with the cheapest Unit Price Exclu. VAT The final Benefit Target Type that you can choose is Qualifying Lines, this gives a specific line discount percentage or amount to all the lines which qualify. If the Prompt for Confirmation option is ticked then the user is presented with the Promotion Confirmation dialogue box, this gives a choice of which of these qualifying lines to allow the promotion to apply to. By default all the lines will be selected. One setup field that hasn\u2019t been mentioned yet as part of the Promotion Benefit is Split Benefit Across Target Lines If this option has been left on (this is the default behaviour) it will result in the benefit (the discount) being applied to each of the lines which are targeted (ones that qualify under the Qualification Criteria). For example , if the discount is set at \u00a3120 and three lines are identified as qualifying to receive discount then each of the three lines will receive a \u00a3120 discount, this would give \u00a3360 total discount. If this is left unticked, it will result in the benefit (the discount) being split proportionally across the lines which are targeted (ones that qualify under the Qualification Criteria), so if three lines are identified as qualifying to receive the \u00a3120 discount then it will be spread proportionally over the three lines, giving a total discount of \u00a3120.","title":"Promotions Benefit FastTab"},{"location":"Clever Promotions/User Guide/Promotions Card/Promotions Card/","text":"Keeping with the manual setup, when you click on the New button, a Promotion Card will open. The Promotion Card shows the detail for one individual promotion. It gives the filtering criteria for that promotion, this is a specific set of rules that need to be met to qualify for the promotions benefit. The first part of the Promotions Card is the General FastTab . This includes the unique identifier (No.) a brief description of the promotion, along with general rules for the promotion, such as: the date range that the promotion will be valid for (if left blank it will apply on all dates); whether it cannot be combined with other promotions (explained below); if it applies to a specific currency code (blank means LCY \u2013 local currency, taken from the General Ledger Setup ); whether conversion from other currencies is allowed (explained below); whether benefit multiplication is allowed and whether or not the promotion is enabled. Allocating a currency code means the promotion will only apply to sales documents where the same currency code has been assigned. If you have setup a currency specific promotion card, or a blank code to use your local currency, orders you will not be able to apply the promotion to a sales document with a different currency code, it will error stating 'nothing to apply' unless you have selected allow currency conversion on the promotion card. NB : If a promotion is not ticked as enabled, it will not take effect, or be visible as a promotion to apply, even if its qualifying criteria are met. Looking in more detail at the General FastTab, there are two fields which when selected will change the behaviour of the promotion in certain scenarios. The first is Cannot be Combined, this field has a range of options which you can select from: Blank, On Document or On Line. If the option is left Blank, then it means that this promotion can be applied to a Sales document providing you qualify for it. If you choose to set it to On Document , it means that no other promotion can be applied to a sales document where a promotion already exists, even if some of the lines could qualify for another promotion. The final option is On Line, choosing this option means that if a line qualifies for a promotion another promotion cannot be applied to that same line, even if that line qualifies for a different promotion. The second setup field is Allow Benefit Multiplication. Selecting this option determines whether the benefit of the promotion can be multiplied or not. If this tick box has been selected then the benefits will accrue automatically, allowing the benefit of the promotion to be multiplied. For example , with a BOGOF (Buy One Get One Free) promotion, if this option has been ticked on the Promotion Card then it will allow multiplication, so that if the customer buys three of item X they get another three free. However, for some other promotions it may not be practical to have this multiplication effect, for example in a \"spend \u00a3100 on X and get \u00a320 off\" promotion the company may not want to give a \u00a340 discount if the customer spends \u00a3200. In that case on the Promotion Card the user should leave Allow Benefit Multiplication unticked.","title":"General FastTab"},{"location":"Clever Promotions/User Guide/Promotions Card/Qualification Criteria FastTab/","text":"With the Customer FastTab filled in, we then move onto the Qualification Criteria FastTab . This sets the filter criteria that decides if the specific details on the Sales Document, for that eligible Customer or Customer Price Group, qualify for the promotion. On this tab you can set to filter by minimum quantity, minimum amount, or promotion codes. Below are the different options you have, to determine how to setup your qualification. The first thing to do is setup your Criteria type. If you choose from the dropdown Minimum Quantity (Base), you must also fill in the Amount field, the Item Type (detailed further on in the user guide) and the Item No. field. By choosing this option you are indicating that, to qualify for the promotion, an item on the sales document, matching the Item No in the qualification criteria must have quantity matching or greater than the Amount field in the setup. If you choose to set the criteria type as Minimum Amount, you must also fill in the following fields: Amount, Item Type and Item No. to qualify for this promotion you are indicating that the value of the line with an item matching that of the Item No in your setup must be equal to or greater than the Amount (as a monetary value) populated as part of your qualification criteria. The final criteria type that you can choose is Promotion Code, this is detailed further on in the user guide as there is separate setup around this option. As previously mentioned, there are different Item Types that you can choose from. Selecting any one of these options will affect the way in which both the Item No . field is populated as well as the way in which your qualification criteria will work. If you choose the option Item , then when you use the assist edit (the drop - down arrow next to the field) on the Item No field you will be presented with your Item List. Choosing the option Item Discount Group , your drop-down list will be of the Item Discount Groups you have setup in Dynamics 365 Business Central. NB: Item Discount Groups are applied to Items; the set-up field can be found on the Item card under the Pricing & Sales FastTab The final option to choose from is the Promotion Item Group. Promotion Item Groups are used for assigning a defined set of items to a promotion. A promotion can be created so that when the qualifying criteria are met, items in the Promotion Item Group will receive a discount. Choose New from the Promotion Item Group list to create new groups.

It is useful to understand barcode symbology\u2019s before reading this document. A symbology is how the pattern in a barcode is converted to / from the data it represents. On top of this the data may or may not be in GS1 format. The GS1 specification allows you to pair data to specific categories. You can include more than one of these in an individual barcode. For example, using the GS1 specification you can include the lot number and expiration date in a single barcode. The GS1 specification is not a symbology \u2013 it is a formatting specification for the data that sits on top of the symbology. Operations in the Warehouse app are driven by a list of data items. For example, a receipt will contain a list of data items specifying what data the app needs to get from the user in order to process the receipt. Each data item may contain one or more GS1 identifiers. When a barcode containing GS1 formatted data is scanned by the app it will check each data item to see if it contains a GS1 identifier that matches a field contained in the barcode. If it does, then the value of that data item is set to the value of that field and the data items are submitted to the server. GS1 Data and Processing Logic Format of GS1 barcodes GS1 barcodes allow you to store data for several fields in a single barcode. For example, you could store the item number and serial number in a single barcode instead of generating a barcode for each field. This has obvious efficiency gains in that a single scan, and a single round trip to the server, can be used instead of separate scans for each field. The GS1 data format uses Application Identifiers (henceforth called AIs) to store the data for each field. Different fields have different AIs. A full list can be seen at https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes/application-identifiers The Warehouse app only supports a subset of these AIs \u2013 see Appendix 1 for a list of these AIs. AIs fall into two categories \u2013 fixed length and variable length. Fixed length items have their length set in the GS1 specification \u2013 for example expiration dates are set to be 6 characters long. Variable length items are ended by a delimiter (typically ASCII character 29) or the end of the barcode if a delimiter is not present. The below diagram illustrates the format of a GS1 barcode: All GS1 barcodes start with a FNC1 character. Following that there must be an AI. If an AI is not present, then it is not a valid GS1 barcode. Following that is the data for that AI \u2013 if it is fixed length then the next n characters are read where n is the length from the GS1 specification. If it is variable length, then characters are read until a delimiter or the end of the barcode is encountered. In our example the barcode\u2019s first AI is for the variable length Serial No. field (21). So, the data is read up to the delimiter to give \u2018SERIALNO\u2019. If there is any data after the end of the last AI\u2019s data, then the process is repeated (excluding the FNC1 check). In our example the next AI is for the fixed length Global Trade Item Number field (01) which must be 14 characters long. The data for this field is \u2018GLOBALTRADEITE\u2019. NB : The text below the barcode is in human readable form. The actual data does not contain the brackets around the AIs. The delimiter (ASCII 29) is also not a visible character in text representations of the data. Processing Logic for GS1 barcodes The below flow chart displays the logic for parsing a GS1 barcode in the Warehouse App: There are a few points to make about the GS1 parsing logic : As previously mentioned GS1 barcodes start with a FNC1 character. Some barcode readers strip this out when the barcode is read but some do not. Also, barcodes may contain GS1 data but omit the FNC1 if they have not been produced in accordance with the GS1 specification (\u2018nonstandard\u2019 mode). Therefore, the first step is to check whether this character exists at the start of the barcode, and to remove it if it does. This character is set to \u2018]C1\u2019 but it can be overridden in the settings (see the \u2018Scanner Setup\u2019 section) if a customer has used an incorrect character when generating their barcodes. The next step is to see if the next 2, 3 or 4 characters match one of the supported application identifiers. If they do not, then the barcode is not valid, and it is not processed as GS1. If an application identifier is detected it falls into two categories: Fixed length identifiers. In this case the GS1 specification says the data must be a specified length \u2013 for example Global Trade Item Numbers must be 14 characters long. In this case the parser will read the required number of characters from the data. If there is not enough data present (for example 14 characters are required in the specification but there are only 12 present) the parser reads the characters that are present and still says the barcode is valid GS1 data. Variable length identifiers. In this case the parser reads the data after the identifier until it encounters the delimiter (a gsep or FNC1) or the end of the data. At the end of the process a series of AIs are returned along with the data extracted from the barcode for each AI. Processing Logic The below flow chart displays what the warehouse app does when it receives a barcode from the scanner. The app supports \u2018strict\u2019 (StandardGS1) and \u2018non strict\u2019 (NonStandardGS1) processing modes. If the scanner does not say it is a GS1 formatted barcode the data may nevertheless still be GS1 compliant. If the app is set to non-standard mode it will try and process this data as GS1 even if the scanner says it is not a GS1 barcode. If parsing the data as GS1 fails, the entire text from the barcode is assigned to the current data item. If the barcode is parsed successfully as GS1 data, the parser returns a list of the AIs present and their data. These are then checked against the data items in the current operation. If a scanned AI matches the AI for a data item, then the value of that data item is set to the data for that AI. Appendix 3 lists the AIs that are defined for each operation. Supported Scanners The Warehouse app can work with Honeywell and Zebra scanners. The below tables say which scanners should work with the app according to the manufacturer\u2019s documentation, and which scanners we have actually tested. Honeywell Scanners We use version 1.31 of the Honeywell Barcode reader SDK. This supports the below models: Model Name Android Version Tested Notes CN51 Marshmallow Y CN75, CN75e, CK75 Marshmallow Dolphin CN80 Nougat Dolphin CT50 KitKat, Marshmallow Dolphin CT60 Nougat Dolphin 75e KitKat, Marshmallow EDA50, EDA50K, EDA70 Nougat EDA60K Nougat Y This device is not listed in the release notes from the Honeywell SDK but it works NB : That some Honeywell scanners are not configured to return the GS1 delimiter by default \u2013 so parsing of variable length GS1 data may give incorrect results. To enable the scanner to return this delimiter scan this barcode: Zebra Scanners We use version 4 of the Zebra SDK (Symbol. Xamarin EMDK). This supports the below models: Model Name Android Version Tested Notes MC33 Nougat, Oreo Y PS20 Oreo TC20 Nougat TC25 Nougat TC51 Marshmallow, Nougat TC52 Oreo TC56 Marshmallow, Nougat TC57 Oreo TC70x Marshmallow, Nougat TC72 Oreo TC75x Marshmallow, Nougat TC77 Oreo VC80x Nougat WT6000 Nougat RS507 - RS6000 - RS5000 - RS4000 - DS2278 - DS3678 - DS3608 - LI3608 - LI3678 - TC8000 Lollipop Y This device is supported in a previous version of the Zebra SDK. It works with V4 of the SDK, but not all barcode formats in V4 of the SDK are supported (it does not support Gs1DataMatrix and Gs1QRCode) Android Scanners We support version 4.1 and above. Scanner Set Up In the Warehouse app the scanner can be configured in the Device tab of the settings screen: The fields are: Manufacturer \u2013 this lets you choose the scanner you wish to use. What you can choose depends on the device the app is running on. If the device has a camera one of the options will be Camera \u2013 this will use the Android camera and the ZXing barcode library. If the device has a built-in scanner then this will be selected by default. Barcode Processing \u2013 whether to use \u2018StandardGS1\u2019 (strict) or NonStandardGS1 (non-strict) mode when processing a barcode. See the flowchart earlier in Processing Logic for how it affects the processing. Alternative FNC1 \u2013 if this is populated then the value entered is used instead of the normal FNC1 when a barcode is processed. If nothing is chosen in the Manufacturer field, then no barcodes will be processed in the app. There is a distinction between scanners that can be started automatically (e.g. built in scanners) and those that need to be triggered by the user (e.g. the device\u2019s camera.) The automatic scanners are enabled in the background when barcode input is appropriate - the user then just scans a barcode using the trigger on the device. For the manual scanners a button is added to the user interface which the user must tap to open the scanner. The app detects which scanners are present automatically, with one caveat. When the method in the Honeywell SDK to detect the scanners runs on a non-Honeywell device it crashes the thread the detection processes runs on, meaning no scanners are detected. To get around this the Honeywell detection only runs on devices whose manufacturer is a known Honeywell manufacturer. Currently these include Honeywell and Foxconn . If in future another manufacturer needs to be supported, they can be added to by putting an XML file in the below format at Android/data/com.tecman.Warehouse/files/HoneywellDeviceNames.xml Scanner Diagnostics The app contains a diagnostic facility (as of version 1.0.12.0) which lets the user scan a barcode and see how the app has processed it. It can be accessed from the main menu by viewing going to the hidden buttons (drag the left-hand side of the screen to the right) and selecting \u2018Scanner Diagnostics.\u2019 It uses the scanner that has been set up in the settings screen, if a scanner has not been configured in the app it will display a message advising you of this. This screen contains a Supported GS1 Idents button. Tapping this displays a list of app idents supported by the app (see appendix 1 for a list of these). If the scanner is an automatically starting one (e.g. a built-in scanner) a label will be displayed asking you to scan a barcode. Otherwise (e.g. for a scanner using the camera) a button is displayed which needs to be tapped for you to scan a barcode. The screen also displays the selected scanner and the GS1 option: After a barcode has been scanned the symbology, data format (GS1 or text) and raw text are displayed, and whether it was parsed as a GS1: If the barcode was parsed as a GS1 the values for each detected app ident are displayed. Appendix 1 \u2013 supported application identifiers in the app The below table displays the AIs currently supported (as of version 1.0.12.0) in the Warehouse app. Code Description Length Divisor 00 Serial shipping container code (SSCC) 18 N/A 01 Global trade item number (GTIN / SSC) 14 N/A 02 GTIN of contained trade items 14 N/A 10 Batch or lot number Variable (20) N/A 11 Production Date 6 (YYMMDD) N/A 15 Best before date 6 (YYMMDD) N/A 17 Expiration date 6 (YYMMDD) N/A 21 Serial number Variable (20) N/A 240 Additional product identification assigned by the manufacturer Variable (30) N/A 243 Packaging component number Variable (20) N/A 30 Variable count of items (quantity) Variable (8) N/A 3100 Net weight (kg) 6 N/A 3101 Net weight (kg) 6 10 3102 Net weight (kg) 6 100 3103 Net weight (kg) 6 1000 3104 Net weight (kg) 6 10000 3105 Net weight (kg) 6 100000 3106 Net weight (kg) 6 1000000 3107 Net weight (kg) 6 10000000 3108 Net weight (kg) 6 100000000 3109 Net weight (kg) 6 1000000000 37 Count of trade items (quantity) Variable (8) N/A 403 Routing code Variable (30) N/A 91 Company internal information (weight) 1 N/A If the divisor field is set then the value for that application identifier is divided by the divisor\u2019s value.

It is useful to understand barcode symbology\u2019s before reading this document. A symbology is how the pattern in a barcode is converted to / from the data it represents. On top of this the data may or may not be in GS1 format. The GS1 specification allows you to pair data to specific categories. You can include more than one of these in an individual barcode. For example, using the GS1 specification you can include the lot number and expiration date in a single barcode. The GS1 specification is not a symbology \u2013 it is a formatting specification for the data that sits on top of the symbology. Operations in the Warehouse app are driven by a list of data items. For example, a receipt will contain a list of data items specifying what data the app needs to get from the user in order to process the receipt. Each data item may contain one or more GS1 identifiers. When a barcode containing GS1 formatted data is scanned by the app it will check each data item to see if it contains a GS1 identifier that matches a field contained in the barcode. If it does, then the value of that data item is set to the value of that field and the data items are submitted to the server.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Handheld/Barcode Processing/#gs1-data-and-processing-logic","text":"","title":"GS1 Data and Processing Logic"},{"location":"Handheld/Barcode Processing/#format-of-gs1-barcodes","text":"GS1 barcodes allow you to store data for several fields in a single barcode. For example, you could store the item number and serial number in a single barcode instead of generating a barcode for each field. This has obvious efficiency gains in that a single scan, and a single round trip to the server, can be used instead of separate scans for each field. The GS1 data format uses Application Identifiers (henceforth called AIs) to store the data for each field. Different fields have different AIs. A full list can be seen at https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes/application-identifiers The Warehouse app only supports a subset of these AIs \u2013 see Appendix 1 for a list of these AIs. AIs fall into two categories \u2013 fixed length and variable length. Fixed length items have their length set in the GS1 specification \u2013 for example expiration dates are set to be 6 characters long. Variable length items are ended by a delimiter (typically ASCII character 29) or the end of the barcode if a delimiter is not present. The below diagram illustrates the format of a GS1 barcode: All GS1 barcodes start with a FNC1 character. Following that there must be an AI. If an AI is not present, then it is not a valid GS1 barcode. Following that is the data for that AI \u2013 if it is fixed length then the next n characters are read where n is the length from the GS1 specification. If it is variable length, then characters are read until a delimiter or the end of the barcode is encountered. In our example the barcode\u2019s first AI is for the variable length Serial No. field (21). So, the data is read up to the delimiter to give \u2018SERIALNO\u2019. If there is any data after the end of the last AI\u2019s data, then the process is repeated (excluding the FNC1 check). In our example the next AI is for the fixed length Global Trade Item Number field (01) which must be 14 characters long. The data for this field is \u2018GLOBALTRADEITE\u2019. NB : The text below the barcode is in human readable form. The actual data does not contain the brackets around the AIs. The delimiter (ASCII 29) is also not a visible character in text representations of the data.","title":"Format of GS1 barcodes"},{"location":"Handheld/Barcode Processing/#processing-logic-for-gs1-barcodes","text":"The below flow chart displays the logic for parsing a GS1 barcode in the Warehouse App: There are a few points to make about the GS1 parsing logic : As previously mentioned GS1 barcodes start with a FNC1 character. Some barcode readers strip this out when the barcode is read but some do not. Also, barcodes may contain GS1 data but omit the FNC1 if they have not been produced in accordance with the GS1 specification (\u2018nonstandard\u2019 mode). Therefore, the first step is to check whether this character exists at the start of the barcode, and to remove it if it does. This character is set to \u2018]C1\u2019 but it can be overridden in the settings (see the \u2018Scanner Setup\u2019 section) if a customer has used an incorrect character when generating their barcodes. The next step is to see if the next 2, 3 or 4 characters match one of the supported application identifiers. If they do not, then the barcode is not valid, and it is not processed as GS1. If an application identifier is detected it falls into two categories: Fixed length identifiers. In this case the GS1 specification says the data must be a specified length \u2013 for example Global Trade Item Numbers must be 14 characters long. In this case the parser will read the required number of characters from the data. If there is not enough data present (for example 14 characters are required in the specification but there are only 12 present) the parser reads the characters that are present and still says the barcode is valid GS1 data. Variable length identifiers. In this case the parser reads the data after the identifier until it encounters the delimiter (a gsep or FNC1) or the end of the data. At the end of the process a series of AIs are returned along with the data extracted from the barcode for each AI.","title":"Processing Logic for GS1 barcodes"},{"location":"Handheld/Barcode Processing/#processing-logic","text":"The below flow chart displays what the warehouse app does when it receives a barcode from the scanner. The app supports \u2018strict\u2019 (StandardGS1) and \u2018non strict\u2019 (NonStandardGS1) processing modes. If the scanner does not say it is a GS1 formatted barcode the data may nevertheless still be GS1 compliant. If the app is set to non-standard mode it will try and process this data as GS1 even if the scanner says it is not a GS1 barcode. If parsing the data as GS1 fails, the entire text from the barcode is assigned to the current data item. If the barcode is parsed successfully as GS1 data, the parser returns a list of the AIs present and their data. These are then checked against the data items in the current operation. If a scanned AI matches the AI for a data item, then the value of that data item is set to the data for that AI.

In reality, all transactional functions on the device use the same mechanism meaning that the device client focuses purely on rendering a user interface while the framework plus extensions drive the entire transaction. The user is currently signed into the WHITE warehouse. Round Trip #1 The first-round trip is made. At this point the device has no validation or contextual data and does not know what Data Items are required to process the receipt. The framework/handheld for warehousing returns the following response data\u2026 DataItem Name Value Locked DocumentNo \\<blank> FALSE SourceDocument \\<blank> TRUE SourceType \\<blank> TRUE LocationCode \\<blank> TRUE NoOfLabels 1 TRUE ItemNo \\<blank> FALSE VariantCode \\<blank> FALSE Description \\<blank> TRUE UnitOfMeasure \\<blank> TRUE QtyOutstanding \\<blank> TRUE LotNo \\<blank> FALSE SerialNo \\<blank> FALSE Quantity \\<blank> FALSE ExpirationDate \\<blank> FALSE WarrantyDate \\<blank> FALSE No ColumnStyle data is returned, we do not have anything to display at this point (Although we could if we needed to). When a Data Item is marked as Locked the device will not prompt for it. This data may be there for contextual or display purposes, or it may be unlocked later in the process. Notice that the SourceDocument, SourceType, Description, UnitOfMeasure and QtyOutstanding DataItems are locked at the outset. These will be used for display purposes to guide the user as the transaction progresses. Notice that VariantCode, LotNo, SerialNo, ExpirationDate and WarrantyDate are not currently locked \u2013 these may or may not become locked once ItemNo is entered or scanned dependent upon whether the Item is \u2018Item Tracked\u2019. Round Trip #2 Now the device knows what pieces of data are required to complete a receipt transaction and it asks the user to enter the first unlocked DataItem : DocumentNo. The user enters the purchase order number on the supplied documentation (For the sake of the example let\u2019s say Purchase Order No. 106044 ). The following validation data is sent. DataItem Name Value DocumentNo 106044 DataItem Name Value Locked SourceDocument \\<blank> TRUE SourceType \\<blank> TRUE LocationCode \\<blank> TRUE NoOfLabels 1 TRUE ItemNo \\<blank> FALSE VariantCode \\<blank> FALSE Description \\<blank> TRUE UnitOfMeasure \\<blank> TRUE QtyOutstanding \\<blank> TRUE LotNo \\<blank> FALSE SerialNo \\<blank> FALSE Quantity \\<blank> FALSE We have not collected much contextual data so far, but it is also passed to the Clever Handheld Framework\u2026 As previously stated, the framework does not maintain context internally \u2013 it\u2019s far simpler to maintain the small amount of contextual data on the device and pass it with each round trip. Why do we do this? Because as the transaction progresses, we need to retain this information to complete the receipt; we cannot complete a receipt without the document number, item number, variant (If required), quantity etc. and we cannot validate an item without knowing the document number. Clever Handheld for Warehousing now knows that it needs to validate a Document No. of 106044. It finds the purchase order number and collects a set of response data to return\u2026 DataItem Name Value Locked DocumentNo 106044 TRUE SourceDocument Purchase Order TRUE SourceType 39 TRUE LocationCode WHITE TRUE NoOfLabels 1 TRUE ItemNo \\<blank> FALSE VariantCode \\<blank> FALSE Description \\<blank> TRUE UnitOfMeasure \\<blank> TRUE QtyOutstanding \\<blank> TRUE LotNo \\<blank> FALSE SerialNo \\<blank> FALSE Quantity \\<blank> FALSE ExpirationDate \\<blank> FALSE WarrantyDate \\<blank> FALSE Notice that DocumentNo has now been locked, we do not want the device to prompt for the source document again as we have collected that data. We also want to display this information, so we prepare a ColumnStyleGroup encapsulating the following ColumnStyle data.

All Handheld for Warehousing events pass .Sender , but as the Clever Handheld Framework is generally two-steps removed the base functions are accessible only via the HHF Session Mgt. Codeunit (Referred to below as SessionMgt ). HHF Session Mgt is a singleton, or single-instance codeunit. To clarify, when subscribed to an event in Clever Handheld for Warehousing you can use .Sender to gain access to public functions in Handheld for Warehousing, but to access the functions in the framework (For instance InitialiseDataItem) you will need to go via HHF Session Mgt. HHF Session Mgt. also maintains useful session data such as whether this is a handheld session, current user, current device, current location etc. SessionMgt.GetContent GetContent(DataItemName : Text) : Text GetContent is used to get the data held in a DataItem. For instance, SessionMgt.GetContent('ItemNo') will return the value of the ItemNo DataItem . SessionMgt.SetContent SetContent(DataItemName : Text;DataItemValue : Text) : Text SetContent is used to set the data held in a DataItem. Example: SessionMgt.SetContent('ItemNo',\u20191100\u2019) This will set the value of the ItemNo DataItem to \u201c1100\u201d. This does not set the Locked Property of the DataItem. To set this Property, see the SetResponseData function. SessionMgt.InitResponseData InitResponseData(DataItemName : Text;DataItemCaption : Text;ItemLock : Boolean) InitResponseData is primarily used to initialise DataItems at the start of a transaction or immediately following a \u2018POST\u2019 action. Example: SessionMgt.InitResponseData('ItemNo', ItemJnlLine.FIELDCAPTION(\u201cItem No.\u201d), FALSE); SessionMgt.InsertResponseData InsertResponseData(DataItemName : Text; BeforeDataItem : Text;DataItemCaption : Text;ItemLock : Boolean) InsertResponseData is as per InitResponseData but inserts the DataItem between other DataItems. SessionMgt.AddGS1AppIdent AddGS1AppIdent(DataItemName : Text;Ident : Integer) Usually follows immediately after InitResponseData , this applies a GS1 Application Identifier to the DataItem. Example: SessionMgt.SetResponseData SetResponseData(DataItemName : Text;ContentValue : Text;ItemLock : Boolean) SetResponseData sets the value of a particular Response DataItem and can then lock the DataItem on the device. Example: SessionMgt.SetResponseData(\u2018ItemNo\u2019, Item.\u201dNo.\u201d, TRUE); SessionMgt.GetTransLocked GetTransLocked(DataItemName : Text) : Boolean GetTransLocked is used to return the locked state of the DataItem as a Boolean. It is specific to transactional processing. Example: This will return the Locked Property of the ItemNo DataItem to the SetResponseData function and use it to set the Locked Property. SessionMgt.AddTransColumnStyleGroup AddTransColumnStyleGroup(GroupName : Text;GroupCaption : Text) A ColumnStyleGroup is a grouping of ColumnStyles, this is purely a visual element for grouping related data together on the device. Each ColumnStyle must belong to a ColumnStyleGroup. This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.InsertTransColumnStyleGroup InsertTransColumnStyleGroup(GroupName : Text; InsertGroupName : Text;GroupCaption : Text) As per AddTransColumnStyleGroup , but inserts between other groups. SessionMgt.AddTransColumnStyle AddTransColumnStyle(GroupName : Text;ColumnName : Text;ColumnCaption : Text;ColumnWidth : Decimal) A ColumnStyle is a purely visual element to be displayed on the device to the user. It must map to an existing DataItem name. Below is an Example of a ColumnStyle and ColumnStyleGroup: This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.GetTransResponseCode GetTransResponseCode() : Text GetTransResponseCode is used to return the value of the ResponseCode. Example: IF SessionMgt.GetTransResponseCode = \u2018YESNO\u2019 THEN This will return the ResponseCode Property. If it has been set then the Client will show a prompt. See the Yes \\ No Prompt Example further on in the Developers Guide for a full example of how to us this function. This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.GetTransConfirmed GetTransConfirmed() : Text GetTransConfirmed is used to return the value of the ConfirmedFlag. Example: IF UPPERCASE(SessionMgt.GetTransConfirmedFlag) = 'FALSE' THEN This will check the value of the ConfirmedFlag. It will only have been set if the prompt Box (i.e Yes \\ No) has shown and the user has selected a value. Otherwise it\u2019s value will be blank. Here is a table of the ConfirmFlag values: For more information see the Yes \\ No Prompt Example later in the guide for a full example of how to us this function. This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.SetTransResponseCode SetTransResponseCode(ResponseCode2 : Text) SetTransResponseCode is used to set the value of the ResposeCode for the confirmation message. Example: SessionMgt.SetTransResponseCode(\u2018YESNO\u2019); This will set the value of the ResponseCode variable to YESNO. This will tell the client to prompt for a Yes \\ No response from the user. This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.SetTransResponseMessage SetTransResponseMessage(ResponseMessage2 : Text) SetTransResponseMessage is used to set the value of the ResposeMessage for the confirmation message. Example: Session.SetTransResponseMessage(\u2018Are you sure you want to do that thing?\u2019); This will set the value of the ResponseMessage variable to \u2018Are you sure you want to do that thing?\u2019. This will be displayed to the user when the prompt is displayed. For more information see the Yes \\ No Prompt Example for a full example of how to us this function. This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.SetDeviceUserID SetDeviceUserID(DeviceName2 : Text[50];UserID2 : Code[20];LocationCode2 : Code[20]) SetDeviceUserID is used to set the user and \\ or location for a specific device. SessionMgt.GetDeviceUserID GetDeviceUserID() : Code[20] GetDeviceUserID is used to get the user ID running on the device which makes the request. SessionMgt.AddTransLookupColumnStyle AddTransLookupColumnStyle(ParentDataItem : Text;ColumnName : Text;ColumnCaption Text;ColumnTableNo : Integer;ColumnFieldNo : Integer;ColumnImportance : Integer) Part of the replacement suite of functions for BuildResponseLookup . The new functions allow multiple columns in a lookup with the ability to specify the \u2018Importance\u2019 of a column of data. AddTransLookupColumnStyle should always be used to specify the columns to be displayed before populating the lookup. Once Columns are set the developer may either use BuildTransLookup to build a lookup from a RecordRef, or AddTransLookupRow and AddTransLookupRowColumn to build a lookup manually. For a full example of how to use this see BuildTransLookup . This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.BuildTransLookup BuildTransLookup(DataItemName : Text;LookupTable : RecordRef) Part of the replacement suite of functions for BuildResponseLookup . The new functions allow multiple columns in a lookup with the ability to specify the \u2018Importance\u2019 of a column of data. Before using this function, the developer should use AddTransLookupColumnStyle to specify the data to be displayed. The RecordRef/table can be filtered and sorted prior to calling BuildTransLookup . Temporary tables can also be used. For cases where it is not possible to build a lookup from a table, see the AddTransLookupRow and AddTransLookupRowColumn functions. Example : This example builds a list of purchase orders against a DataItem called \u2018DocumentKey\u2019. On the device, a list of purchase orders is displayed showing Document No. and Vendor Order No \u2026 Clicking on the + key reveals the additional Order Date and Expected Receipt Date values\u2026 This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.AddTransLookupRow AddTransLookupRow(ParentDataItem : Text;LookupKey : Text) Before using this function, the developer should use AddTransLookupColumnStyle to specify the data to be displayed. BuildTransLookup should be used in preference where a table is available (Temporary or otherwise). This function specifies a new row for the lookup \u2013 individual columns should be added using AddTransLookupRowColumn . Example: The above code sets a lookup against DataItem \u2018ActStatus\u2019, then manually adds three rows: Full, Part or None. This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.AddTransLookupRowColumn AddTransLookupRowColumn(ParentDataItem : Text;ColumnName : Text;ColumnValue : Text) This function populates a column in an existing row for the lookup \u2013 rows should be added using AddTransLookupRow . Example: This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.DeleteTransLookup DeleteTransLookup(DataItemName : Text) Deletes all lookup data against the parent data item specified in DataItemName . This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.AddTransSubFunction AddTransSubFunction(SubFunctionName : Text;SubFunctionCaption : Text) AddTransSubFunction can be used to create a custom child function of the current function. This will appear on the device under an ellipsis menu (\u2026) When a sub function is selected, the validate event for the parent function is called. The name of the sub function is written into the \u201cRequestSubFuncCode\u201d variable. The developer can check: That this variable is not blank Which function name this variable has been set to \u2026 and then act accordingly. This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.ValidateTransDataItem ValidateTransDataItem(DataItemName : Text;ContentValue : Text;ItemLock : Boolean) ValidateTransDataItem can be used to fire Validation again for a data item. Will allow the developer to set a DataItem with a new value and force it to validate, without having to copy any of the standard validation code into their bespoke codeunit. Example: For a full example of how to use this see the ValidateDataItem example. One potential danger with this function is that it might cause the code to end up in an infinite loop. Once an item has been Validated, its Data State is set from \u201cValidate\u201d to \u201cContext \u201c. This function works by setting it back to \u201cValidate\u201d again. It is important to use this function with care. To guard against this eventuality, Handheld Framework counts the number of times that a DataItem has been Validated. If the same item has been validated more than 2 times, then it will throw an error: This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.GetHandheldSession GetHandheldSession() : Boolean Can be used to determine if we are running in a Handheld session. Useful when customising and extending functionality. SessionMgt.GetTransResponseDataType GetTransResponseDataType(DataItemName : Text) : Integer GetTransResponseDataType returns the ResponseDataType of the DataItem. The ResponseDataType can be used to change the behaviour of the DataItem. For example, if the ResponseDataType is Masked then when the DataItem is prompted for, text entered will appear as \u201c***\u201d (password characters). Example: ResponseDataType := SessionMgt.GetTransResponseDataType(\u2018ItemNo\u2019); This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.SetTransResponseDataType SetTransResponseDataType(DataItemName : Text;DataItemType : ' ,Masked') SetTransResponseDataType sets the ResponseDataType of the DataItem. The ResponseDataType can be used to change the behaviour of the DataItem. For example, if the ResponseDataType is Masked then when the DataItem is prompted for, text entered will appear as \u201c***\u201d (password characters). Example: SessionMgt.SetResponseDataType(\u2018Password\u2019,MobileContent.Type::Masked); This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.RemoveTransColumnStyleGroup RemoveTransColumnStyleGroup(GroupName : Text) RemoveTransColumnStyleGroup can be used to remove an entire group of DataItems from the display without removing it from the underlying contextual data. ItemNo is often displayed as a group of ItemNo and Description. If you were to remove the ItemNo ColumnStyleGroup this would remove both ItemNo and Description from the display. Example: SessionMgt.RemoveTransColumnStyleGroup(\u2018ItemNo\u2019); This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.RemoveTransColumnStyle RemoveTransColumnStyle(ColumnName : Text) RemoveTransColumnStyle can be used to remove a single DataItem from the display without removing it from the underlying contextual data. ItemNo is often displayed as a group of ItemNo and Description. If you were to remove the ItemNo ColumnStyle this would remove Only ItemNo and not Description from the display. Example: SessionMgt.RemoveTransColumnStyle(\u2018ItemNo\u2019); This function is specific to transactional processing. SessionMgt.GetTransFixedDataItem GetTransFixedDataItem(DataItemName : Text) : Boolean GetTransFixedDataItem returns the Boolean value for whether the supplied DataItem is Fixed. If a DataItem is Fixed, this means that it is mandatory and must have a value. For example, the Item No. is mandatory on a Pick as this must be supplied for the pick to work. If a DataItem is set as Non-Fixed, then this means that it is optional and does not have to be supplied for the process \\ function to work. For example, Shipping Agent Code is not Fixed in the Shipping function. If a DataItem is not fixed, this means that it can be disabled. Disabling it will mean that it will not be prompted for on the Device Client (the value for this DataItem can still be set through code). SessionMgt.GetTransFixedDataItemEnabled GetTransFixedDataItemEnabled (DataItemName : Text) : Boolean GetTransFixedDataItemEnabled returns the Boolean value for whether the supplied Fixed DataItem is Enabled. SessionMgt.SetTransFixedDataItem SetTransFixedDataItem(DataItemName : Text;FixedDataItem : Boolean) SetTransFixedDataItem sets the Boolean flag \u201cFixed Data Item\u201d for the supplied DataItem to the supplied value. If this value is set to true then the DataItem becomes optional. SessionMgt.GetLocationCode GetLocationCode() : Code[20] GetLocationCode gets the Location Code for the user which made the request.

To get to the Device Enquiries screen you can either go through the Device Functions page as per the screen shot below or using the search function to directly navigate to the page. If you are using the Device Functions page to navigate to the Device enquires page, simply click on one of the functions which has the Type Field populated as Enquiry. You can either select view, edit or drill into the three lines. Click on the Select from Full List option, which will then take you to the Device Enquiries page. You will be presented with a list of all the Enquiry Codes created. Click on the Select from Full List option, which will then take you to the Device Enquiries page. Whichever option you have taken will take you to the same page, the Device Enquiries page. Once on the page you will see how there are already Device Enquires setup these have been imported, these have come from running the Get Default Configuration (detailed at the beginning of the user guide). Each Device Enquiry has a Unique Code , a Description describing what that code means. The Data Source is based on a Table No of where the enquiry will pull the data from in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. By choosing the data source the Data Source Name will automatically populated based on your choice. On the ribbon along the top of the page, options such as: Filters, Columns and Relationships can be selected per highlighted Device Enquiry, these are used to specify required filters on the device, the columns to display, and the related data that we will potentially drill-down to. When you highlight a device enquiry and click on the filters button you are presented with the following page By applying filters to the device enquiry, you are minimising the amount of records presented to you. The example above, shows how filters have been applied to the Item Enquiry function by Location Code and Item No. Location Code is marked as Fixed. This means the device will not prompt for it, it will use the value in the Filter column. Certain \u201creserved words\u201d are allowed in the Filter, for instance %CURRLOC% uses the current location, or %TODAY% uses todays date. All of which means that Location Code in Bin Contents (data Source) is filtered to the current location automatically with no user entry required. Item No. is not Fixed so it will be prompted for. GS1 Ident is set to Item No. so if a barcode is scanned containing a matching GS1 Identifier for Item then it will be used to map to the Item No. filter. The next option down from filters is the Columns. In this page you can modify the columns that you want to be visible when accessed by the user on the device. The fields available are based on the Data Source to display. To add a new column, click on the field labelled Field No , if you know the field you want to add simply type in the no, otherwise use the assist next to the field (three little dots)this will present you with a list of all the fields you can pick from. Mentioned previously these fields are based on your data source. The Column Name will automatically populate a soon as you type in or choose your field no. You have the option to add in a Column Caption to each of the columns in your enquiry . If a caption is added this is what your warehouse users will see as the field name rather than the one in the filed Column Name . The next field along determines whether this field should be visible or not. If you have set the field to be visible you can then apply its Importance. There are three levels of importance that you can select or change current setup to be. By setting the column to be Standard \u2026. By choosing Promoted you want that column and the information held against it visible at first glance.

In the same area, that the new user is created (detailed further on in the user guide), there is a Device Menu Code option, this is where you can choose which device menu code each user is assigned, depending on job role can see something different. When we talk about Device Menus these are the screens on the device that the user sees, how they look, the size of the button, the colour of the buttons and the functions that enable you to carry out a certain actions when you select them. By default, the rapid start package run on installation will import a default device menu. This device menu contains all functions and actions that you may want to carry out on the device. You can get to this page either through the search on your role centre or using the menus to navigate to it. Once on the page highlight the code already created and click edit. This will open up the setup behind this device menu. The General FastTab is split into three different fields the first is the Code , a unique identifier given to the device menu created. You then have the Description field which describes the device menu. Finally, there is the Default Theme Code , you can change the Default Theme Code to be another code, by using the drop down next to the field and selecting one of the other options available. The list you are selecting from are codes held on the Device Themes page. The codes created give you the flexibility to change the colour backgrounds and buttons on the device. You could create each menu or go as far as each function with its own colour theme. This for example could highlight to the user on the device what process they are currently doing. After the General FastTab there is a section called Hot-Keys. Populating any of these fields allows users to jump in and out of processes without existing one function to carry out another. For example, when a user is doing a pick, they may need to do an item enquiry or a bin enquiry. The Hot- Key Functions fields in this FastTab relate to the buttons on the devices. NB : You may be limited to how many of these fields you can populate based on the device you are using. The final part of the Device menu looks at the functions of the menu, how they are displayed, what the images are to represent the functions, the button colours and the themes behind them. In here you can remove functions that you may not want a particular group of people to work on, or it may not even be part of your business processes. You can modify the Description, making the functions that you are keeping more relatable. For instance, your warehouse employees may not know what a Phys.Inv means, however changing it to Stock Count or Stock Take makes it more relatable to them and what they do in the warehouse. Changing the Device Theme Code , per device function makes the processes clear to the warehouse what needs to be done and more user friendly as they are not being blinded by harsh colours (making it difficult to see the functions on the screen). Setting Thresholds against the functions helps users identify what level is critical to the business day. NB : You should not modify the default Device Menu, instead, use the Copy action on the Device Menu page.

Advanced Warehousing Picking When setting up your locations for certain warehouse processes, you may decide that you want to setup your warehouse for Directed Put- away and Pick, a setting on the Location card under the Warehouse FastTab. Directed Put-Away & Pick gives you access to advanced warehouse configuration features that can greatly enhance your efficiency and data reliability. In order to use this functionality, you must first set up several parameters in your warehouse location, such as Bin Types and Zones. When doing a pick in an advanced location the first thing that you will be asked is to determine what Zone you are working in. The zones you see on the device come from a setup page called Zones . Zones which have a Bin Type code flagged for Pick will be visible. NB : If you create an entry in the Handheld Whse. Zones if will use entries in that page to show on the device compared to that of the default zones. Once you have chosen your Zone, you will then be prompted as to whether you want to pick a specific pick or not. Once you have selected your option the picking process will be as above, being prompted at certain stages for certain information. Based on how your warehouse runs there are other functions that can be added to the picking process. These include : Ex. Pick, Invt. Pick & Post Pick. These options aren\u2019t visible on the device menus by default but can be added if you prefer to pick using one of these options instead. Ex.

If the warehouse user chooses No a list of picks for that user will be displayed. Once a selection has been made it run through the pick as described previously prompting at certain points for specific information relating the pick if not given during the scanning of a barcode. Invt. Pick Inventory Picks are used in situations where you require pick processing but not shipment processing, you use the Inventory Picks to organise the picking information, print the picking information, enter the result of the pick, and post the picking information, which in turn posts the shipment of the items. For this function to work correctly there are certain bits of setup that will need to be done to make sure it works. On the Location Card , you need to make sure that you have the Bin Mandatory enabled. You will also need to make sure that the Device menu for that function has been setup correctly, changing the Cue Table ID & Cue Field No. NB : The Picking tile is also linked to a Cue so you will need to modify that as well if you are using inventory picks instead of warehouse picks Once the option has been selected like previous pick processes users will be prompted to pick a specific pick yes or no.

Receipt The Receipt Function allows the device to receipt goods into the warehouse like a user would do in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. By running this process through the device, it will cut out the need for Goods in documents allowing users to directly updated the receipt lines of the purchase order directly. The number indicated next to the receipt button highlights to the user based on the location they are in (indicated at the top of the device) how many receipts need to be actioned, if the location is changed then a different number would appear. After the receipt tile has been selected the device will prompt the user to enter the Warehouse Receipt Arrivals number that you want to receipt \u2013 this will be the Warehouse Receipt Number On entering the Warehouse Receipt number, you will be prompted to enter the Item No . This will be an item on receipt. If your item is Lot or Serial tracked you will also be prompted to enter this bit of data NB : If you scan in an item that is not on the receipt you will be presented with an error indicating that the item you are trying to receipt in does not belong on this receipt. If the correct item has been scanned or entered you will then be presented with the details relating to the receipt line, including how much the purchase order says should be receipted in. A prompt to enter the Qty to Receive , will then allow the user to say how much of the receipt line they want to physically receipt in (based on how much has been delivered to them) if the full amount has ben delivered they will type in the amount suggested on the device if it is under they can also do that it is known as a partial receipt. NB : You cannot over-receipt on the devices if you have received in more quantity then initially ordered you will need to manually handle the receipt in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. Once the quantity has been entered the user will then be presented with a post button at the bottom of the screen. All data relating to the receipt line will show about including quantity they typed in to receive. If they are happy with everything they simply click the Post button. This will then post the receipt line and give the user the option to receipt another receipt line , or they can go back and use another function. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, the line you have just posted will disappear off the Warehouse Receipt creating a Posted Whse. Receipt . Your posted Whse Receipt document will either be for the full amount or for the partial amount. If it was is for a partial amount then on the Warehouse Receipt the line will still be visible however the Qty. Received will populate with the quantity you just posted leaving an outstanding amount in the Qty. to Receive field. NB: You can also scan the barcode instead of entering the numbers in manually. If a barcode contains multiple pieces of information, then some steps will be skipped as the system will extract all the date from the single scan. The flexibility of our app means there is more than one way in which you might want to process receipts into your warehouse. Standard device functions also include Receipt By Item & Receipt By Vendor . These options aren\u2019t visible on the device menus by default but can be added if you prefer to receipt using one of these options instead. Receipt By Item If this tile is selected the first prompt you will be asked is to scan in the Item No, if it exists on any receipt created for that location (the location you are in on the device) you will then be asked to select which Purchase Order you are working on. You can click on the additional button next to each document shown to see additional fields which help you in determining which Purchase order the item belongs to. Once selected you will carry on receipting as normal populating the Qty to Receive and the posting when prompted. Receipt By Vendor Selecting the tile Receipt by Vendor will first prompt the user to input the Buy- from Vendor No. like the Receipt by Item function you will then be asked which document you will be receipting against. Once selected you will carry on the receipt process as previously described scanning the Item No when promoted and entering the Qty. to Handle before posting the receipt line. Put-Away The second tile in the Receiving menu, is the Put-away tile. The tile allows a user to put-away goods in a warehouse. A put away is created when the receipt lines are posted. However, this will only happen if on the location card you have Require Put-away enabled. To complete a Put-away using the Clever Handheld for Warehousing, the user must first scan the barcode of that Item you want to put-away , this will bring up information regarding that item. The details on the screen will relate to the first warehouse activity line linked to that item, this may not be the put away that you are working on - don\u2019t panic! Once you have entered the Qty. to Handle , so how much of that item you plan on moving within the warehouse, you will then be asked to verify which purchase order you are working on. NB : If a specific barcode was printed relating to the purchase order then this question will not be asked. The user will then be prompted for the Place Bin Code , the place bin is visible on the screen, however the user can choose to change where the stock will be placed. Once this has been confirmed, the user can select Post . After this has been completed, the user will be taken back to the item page, where they can choose to enter another item, or select close to return to the Main Menu. Taking a Photo NB : This functionality only works with Android devices. During the receipt process there is an option to capture a photo. You may use this functionality when goods are damaged, so you need to take a photo in order to explain why the quantity of an item may not have been received in. The option to take a photo will only appear once the Source Document (Purchase Order) has been scanned or selected and the item has been scanned. You will see an options box appear at the bottom of the screen. If you click on it you will be presented with a screen with two functions. One labeled Take Photo and the other is Back. The Take Photo function will use your devices camera functionality to take a picture, once you are happy click the OK button at the top of the screen or Retry to take another picture. In click OK you will be taken back to the receipt process to continue receipting in your item. NB : You can take multiple pictures for one receipt line. You can either take it before you input the quantity to handle, however there is an opportunity before you post to also take a picture if required. If you click Back you will simply be taken back to the receipt process. Pictures are posted against the orginal source documents lines there is a FactBox on the Purchase Order screen called Purchase Line Details . Next to the field Attachments you will see a figure which will increase based on how many pictures you have taken for the purchase line highlighted on your Purchase Order.

There are two different ways in which a stock take can be done. The first option Phys.Inv requires some setup to be done first in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. In the client you will need to navigate to the Phys. Inventory Journal or Whse Phys. Inventory Journal pages. If your location is setup for advanced warehousing you will use the Whse Phys. Inventory. Once on the journal you will run the Calculate Inventory action on the actions tab. The request page will pop up asking you what filters to apply to the entries before pulling them through onto the journal. It is up to you how you would like to create your journal. Once the journal is created you can then run the Assign to Device User function which based on your filter options will apply a Device User to a journal line. Or you can go down each line individually and populate Assigned Handheld User the field. NB : Along with assigning to device users the priority can be set if you want the user to prioritise some journal lines over others. On the device you will see that you know have a figure against the tile Phys.Inv. this indicates to the warehouse employee how many lines have been assigned to them to count. To make sure that the figure is populating correctly you need to make sure your Device Menu setup is correct. The Cue field No. needs to be pointing either at Phys. Inv Lines or Whse. Phys. Inv. Lines - if your location is setup for advanced warehousing. Clicking on the Phys Inv tile the user will be prompted to enter the Bin Code . The bin code along with the Item No and other details are visible on the device. NB : You can hide the quantity by enabling the flag blind stock count in the handheld setup page. Once the bin has been entered you will then be prompted for the Item No, like the previous screen the details can be seen on the device. You will finally be prompted for the Quantity, once confirmed a Post button will appear at the bottom of the device. In posting the line you are updating the corresponding line on the journal you created in previously. NB: Posting the entry on the device does not post the line on the journal. The final posting is done in Microsoft Dynamics 365 business Central by someone like the warehouse manager who is happy with the difference in what the client thinks there is in stock compared to what is physically in the warehouse. You will have noticed during the process that an Option button appeared at the bottom of the device. The options in here depend at which stage of the count process you are at. If you have only scanned in the bin code and then clicked on the option button, you will only see Next Bin . If you have scanned in both the bin code and the item code, and then clicked on the option button you will see both Next Bin and Next Item as options. If you were to select the option Next Bin you would be moved onto the next assigned to your device in the journal. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central the journal lines will be updated as follows: By carrying out the action above on the device you have instigated to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central is that the bin you were in has been counted and to move onto the next bin. In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central what that has done is checked all the lines relating to the bin that you have scanned and negatively adjusted the amounts of all the lines to be 0 (Qty Phys. Inventory). You will also notice this bin and the lines on the journal have now been set as Counted. Marking the line(s) as counted means it will not reappear back on the gun for recount. To do that you would have to set that field back to needs counting. NB : The Count Status field only gets updated when the count is carried out through a device if it is adjusted manually in NAV then the line will remain as Needs Counting. If when you scan the bin you are presented with an item which is no longer in the bin you can choose the option Next Item . This action will appear once the bin code and the item code has been scanned. Once all the items in the bin have been counted whether that\u2019s through simply counting them as they are all there or using the next bin function it will take you out the loop of staying in that bin and move you onto the next bin, where you will be prompted to scan in the next bin. Similarly, to staying in the bin until the Next Bin function is pressed, if there are multiple lots for an item it will stay in that item until all lots have been scanned or the Next Item function has been pressed. NB : If the items you are counting are lot/serial tracked numbers or variants are applied to them you may also be prompted on the device to confirm those bits of data if not already held in a barcode when scanned. Req. Phys. Inv If you choose to run this option instead you don\u2019t need to need to create a journal beforehand. Instead of user being assigned lines to go and count and being directed. they will instead create the Phys. Inventory Journal or Whse Phys. Inventory Journal. When the user clicks on this option they will be asked to scan the Bin Code as soon as they scan in that bin code they will be presented with the first item in that bin, according to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central . Like the Phys. Inv functionality they will then scan the item and type in the quantity. The same options of Next Bin and Next Item are also available and work just like they did in the other function (Phys. Inv). In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central a journal will be created for that mobile warehouse user. For example, the device is logged in as CDDEMO, in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central you will see that name as a journal batch name. As you start to scan in bins and items the journal will start to populate depending on what I have scanned in. Similarly, to the Phys. Inv function if Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central is telling it that there are two items in a bin and you only scan one of the items and hit the Next Bin option it will create the second line on the journal but have the Qty Phys.

Once the journal is posted that is when the adjustments will be made. NB : If lines need recounting and you want them to be done on the device you will have to change the Count Status back to Needs Counting . If you are making the adjustments through Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central this status is not important.

The Default Region Code is used as the default country/region code for Sales Orders where that field is empty. The Country/Region code needs to be filled in one way or another as it helps in determining the Delivery Area (explained later in the user guide) of the order.

As your business starts to expand and you deliver further afield it may be the case that you haven\u2019t had the opportunity to setup new delivery areas to cater to the expansion. To help with this you may want to create a default route or a dummy route where orders can be assigned to and easily identified in the Shipment Managements Route screen to be dealt with later.
