It gives the\nfiltering criteria for that promotion, this is a specific set of rules that need\nto be met to qualify for the promotions benefit.\n\n\n\n\nThe first part of the Promotions Card is the \nGeneral FastTab\n. This includes\nthe unique identifier (No.) a brief description of the promotion, along with\ngeneral rules for the promotion, such as: the date range that the promotion will\nbe valid for (if left blank it will apply on all dates); whether it cannot be\ncombined with other promotions (explained below); if it applies to a specific\ncurrency code (blank means LCY \u2013 local currency, taken from the \nGeneral Ledger\nSetup\n); whether conversion from other currencies is allowed (explained below);\nwhether benefit multiplication is allowed and whether or not the promotion is\nenabled.\n\n\nNB\n: If a promotion is not ticked as enabled, it will not take effect, or be\nvisible as a promotion to apply, even if its qualifying criteria are met.\n\n\nLooking in more detail at the General FastTab, there are two fields which when\nselected will change the behaviour of the promotion in certain scenarios. The\nfirst is \nCannot be Combined,\n this field has a range of options which you can\nselect from: Blank, On Document or On Line.\n\n\n\n\nIf the option is left \nBlank,\n then it means that this promotion can be\napplied to a Sales document providing you qualify for it.\n\n\nIf you choose to set it to \nOn Document\n, it means that no other promotion can\nbe applied to a sales document where a promotion already exists, even if some of\nthe lines could qualify for another promotion.\n\n\nThe final option is \nOn Line,\n choosing this option means that if a line\nqualifies for a promotion another promotion cannot be applied to that same line,\neven if that line qualifies for a different promotion.\n\n\nThe second setup field is \nAllow Benefit Multiplication.\n\n\n\n\nSelecting this option determines whether the benefit of the promotion can be\nmultiplied or not. If this tick box has been selected then the benefits will\naccrue automatically, allowing the benefit of the promotion to be multiplied.\n\n\nFor example\n, with a BOGOF (Buy One Get One Free) promotion, if this option\nhas been ticked on the Promotion Card then it will allow multiplication, so that\nif the customer buys three of item X they get another three free.\n\n\nHowever, for some other promotions it may not be practical to have this\nmultiplication effect, \nfor example\n in a \"spend \u00a3100 on X and get \u00a320 off\"\npromotion the company may not want to give a \u00a340 discount if the customer spends\n\u00a3200. In that case on the Promotion Card the user should leave Allow Benefit\nMultiplication unticked.",

For example, sales quotes and sales\norder confirmations (both of which use table 36) it will allow you to choose a\nseparate primary table document type.\n\n\nNB\n: If you try to set the Primary Table Document Type when you are not using\ntable 36 or 38 then it will error.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nGroup by Field No\n. allows you to set a grouping at document type level,\nallowing you to highlight multiple records and for the app to determine based on\nyour setup how the records should be sent out. For example, if you group by\n\nSell-to Customer No\n. then all records highlighted to be sent will be grouped\nby this field. This means that your customers will not receive multiple emails\nfor individual records, instead they will receive potentially one email with\nmultiple records attached.\n\n\nWhen you click on the assist next to the field you are given all the fields that\nyou can choose from to Group by, these are fields based on your \nPrimary Table\nNo. Filter\n\n\nThe \nGroup Field Name\n simply shows the name of the field you have chosen to\ngroup by.\n\n\nChoosing \nPreview Before Sending\n tells the app that for this document type\nwhen you choose the option to \nSend Email\n (detailed further on in the user\nguide), the preview screen will pop up detailing the records you are sending,\nwho they are being sent to and how they are being grouped.",

If multiple\nrecords have been selected and then grouped it will use the \nBatch Subject\n\nfield as the subject of the email received by the recipient(s).\n\n\nIt is only when the option \nQueue Email\n, (explained in more detail further on\nin the user guide) is used that the information in the \nSender Name\n and\n\nSender Address\n will be used\n\n\nNB\n: The Batch Subject will also be used when choosing to Queue the emails\nrather than send them straight away.",

            "text": "Just below delivery we have the \nAttachments\n aspect of the Delivery Type. It\nis within this screen that you will be able to attach the report you plan on\nsending out to that customer or vendor, later in the user guide we will talk\nabout attaching attachments alongside or combined with reports.\n\n\nThe \nAttachment Type\n at this stage should be set to \nReport\n. Once you have\nchosen your report you will notice both the \nAttachment Name\n and the \nBatch\nAttachment Name\n will automatically populate with text written in the \nReport\nName\n field. These can be changed (not the report name field) but the\nattachment & batch attachment name fields. Changing these fields will change the\ndescription of the attachment sent out to your recipients.\n\n\nLike the above scenario the app queries whether to use the Subject or the Batch\nsubject, it will also query when to use the Attachment Name (single records) or\nBatch Attachment Name (Grouped or queued records).\n\n\nThe option to \nStore Documents\n should be used with caution and only really\nused on posted documents. Storing a document holds a record, at that point in\ntime of how the document was, if you were to change that document and resend the\namended version out again, the app will first look to the Stored Documents list,\nand if it finds a match it will resend the orginal document out again. In an\never-changing environment of sales order processing it would not work to Store\nthe document records.\n\n\nRetention Period\n defines the period that the document should be kept in the\nDocument Store for. The \u201cStore Until\u201d field on the Document Store table will be\npopulated when the report is created.\n\n\nEach attachment can be set as a \nWatermark\n or \nMerge\n (added as additional\npages to the back) or added as a separate attachment to the email. Attachments\ncan be set to apply to only prints or only emails fro example only add the T&C\u2019s\nattachment when emailing, not printing. This is set in the field \nFile\nProcessing Type\n\n\n\n\nAgainst the attachments there are several actions which can alter an attachment\nand the way it is presented as part of that document type.\n\n\nNew Line\n and \nDelete Line\n will either allow you to create a new\nattachment record against the document type or delete an attachment line you are\nno longer using.\n\n\nDoc. Type Attachment Card\n will open a detailed attachment card based on the\nattachment record you have highlighted to view. The \nDoc. Type Attachment\nCard\n will be explained further on in the user guide in more detail.\n\n\nClicking on option \nEdit Request Page\n will open the reports request page,\nthis is a set of filter options to run that report. For example, running the\nrequest page for Posted Sales Invoices you may what to filter out all invoices\nevery time the document type is run (PSI) to not include Customers with location\nWhite.\n\n\nNB\n: If not done then the first time you process a record for a document type\nwhich hasn\u2019t had the request page flagged as run, then it will prompt you to set\nthose options or filters as part of the process before it can send the document\nout. After the first time it will keep those settings and not ask again.\n\n\n\n\nIf at any point you need to modify the request page the action \nClear Request\nPage,\n will remove all report filters for that document type and unflag the\nattachment line as having no request page.\n\n\nChoosing the action \nOptions\n allows you to set a calculation against any of\nthe date fields on the attachments request page.\n\n\nThis is mainly used on the Statement (STMNT) Document Type. You set the\ncalculations against the fields StartDate and End Date so that every month when\nthe statement is run it is running for the correct date criteria.\n\n\n\n\nNB: If the calculations weren\u2019t set in here, you would need to make sure that\nevery month a user would need to go into this document type and change the\nrequest page. If they didn\u2019t the statements would be set out using the previous\nmonths date range.\n\n\nTo change the order in which attachments are displayed on your emails being sent\nout use the \nMove Up\n or \nMove Down\n actions.",
