It gives the\nfiltering criteria for that promotion, this is a specific set of rules that need\nto be met to qualify for the promotions benefit.\n\n\n\n\nThe first part of the Promotions Card is the \nGeneral FastTab\n. This includes\nthe unique identifier (No.) a brief description of the promotion, along with\ngeneral rules for the promotion, such as: the date range that the promotion will\nbe valid for (if left blank it will apply on all dates); whether it cannot be\ncombined with other promotions; if it applies to a specific currency code (blank\nmeans LCY \u2013 local currency, usually GB \u00a3); whether conversion from other\ncurrencies is allowed; whether benefit multiplication is allowed and whether or\nnot the promotion is enabled.\n\n\nNB\n: If a promotion is not ticked as enabled, it will not take effect, or be\nvisible as a promotion to apply, even if its qualifying criteria are met.\n\n\nLooking in more detail at the General FastTab, there are 2 fields which when\nselected will change the behaviour of the promotion in certain scenarios. The\nfirst is \nCannot be Combined,\n this field has a range of options which you can\nselect from: Blank, On Document or On Line.\n\n\n\n\nIf the option is left \nBlank,\n then it means that this promotion can be\napplied to a Sales document providing you qualify for it.\n\n\nIf you choose to set it to \nOn Document\n, it means that no other promotion can\nbe applied to a sales document where a promotion already exists.\n\n\nThe final option is \nOn Line,\n choosing this option means that if a line\nqualifies for a promotion another promotion cannot be applied to that same line,\neven if that line qualifies for a different promotion.\n\n\nThe second setup field is \nAllow Benefit Multiplication.\n\n\n\n\nSelecting this option determines whether the benefit of the promotion can be\nmultiplied or not. If this tick box has been selected then the benefits will\naccrue automatically, allowing the benefit of the promotion to be multiplied.\n\n\nFor example\n, with a BOGOF (Buy One Get One Free) promotion, if this option\nhas been ticked on the Promotion Card then it will allow multiplication, so that\nif the customer buys 3 of item X they get another 3 free.\n\n\nHowever, some other promotions may not wish to have this multiplication effect,\n\nfor example\n in a \"spend \u00a3100 on X and get \u00a320 off\" promotion the company may\nnot want to give a \u00a340 discount if the customer spends \u00a3200. In that case on the\nPromotion Card the user should leave Allow Promotion Benefit unticked.",

If this option\nis selected, you should then choose the \nBenefit Target Item Type,\n indicating\nspecifically what type of line you want the benefit to be applied to. Options\ninclude: Item, Item Discount Group or Promotion Code. Once you have chosen your\ntarget item type, the last bit of setup is to determine what you would like to\nhappen to each line, your options include applying a \nLine Discount Amount\n or\na \nLine Discount %.\n Once completed an optional confirmation checkbox,\n\nPrompt for Confirmation\n, will (if ticked) allow the user to manually include\nor exclude lines.\n\n\n\n\nIf the option \nNew Line\n is selected as the Benefit Target Type, it suggests\nthat, if the Sales Document meets the qualifying criteria of the promotion then\na new line will be added to your Sales Document. Choosing this option will\nautomatically populate the Benefit Target Item Type (no drop down to show other\noptions). You must then choose the \nBenefit Target Item No\n. to indicate which\nitem will be added as a new line, as well as \nNew line Quantity\n (how much of\nthe new item you want to add), \nDiscount type\n and \nDiscount Amount\n, which\nare mentioned above.\n\n\nIf you select the option \nCheapest line\n, this will give the chosen discount %\nor amount on the cheapest line of the sales document. If this option is chosen\nyou must also setup the \nDiscount type\n and \nDiscount Amount.\n\n\nThe final Benefit Target Type that you can choose is \nQualifying Lines,\n this\ngives a specific line discount percentage or amount to all the lines which\nqualify.\n\n\nIf the Prompt for Confirmation option is ticked then the user is presented with\nthe Promotion Confirmation dialogue box, this gives a choice of which of these\nqualifying lines to allow the promotion to apply to. By default, all the lines\nwill be selected.\n\n\n\n\nOne setup field that hasn\u2019t been mentioned yet as part of the Promotion Benefit\nis \nSplit Benefit Across Target Lines\n\n\nIf this option has been left on the default behaviour, it will result in the\nbenefit (the discount) being applied to each of the lines which are targeted\n(ones that qualify under the Qualification Criteria).\n\n\nFor example\n, if the discount is set at \u00a3120 and three lines are identified\nas qualifying to receive discount then each of the three lines will receive a\n\u00a3120 discount, this would give \u00a3360 total discount.\n\n\nIf this is set to the alternative behaviour on the Promotion Card, it will\nresult in the benefit (the discount) being split proportionally across the lines\nwhich are targeted (ones that qualify under the Qualification Criteria), so if\nthree lines are identified as qualifying to receive the \u00a3120 discount then it\nwill be spread proportionally over the three lines, giving a total discount of\n\u00a3120.",
