This includes\nthe unique identifier (No.) a brief description of the promotion, along with\ngeneral rules for the promotion, such as: the date range that the promotion will\nbe valid for (if left blank it will apply on all dates); whether it cannot be\ncombined with other promotions (explained below); if it applies to a specific\ncurrency code (blank means LCY \u2013 local currency, taken from the \nGeneral Ledger\nSetup\n); whether conversion from other currencies is allowed (explained below);\nwhether benefit multiplication is allowed and whether or not the promotion is\nenabled.\n\n\nNB\n: If a promotion is not ticked as enabled, it will not take effect, or be\nvisible as a promotion to apply, even if its qualifying criteria are met.\n\n\nLooking in more detail at the General FastTab, there are two fields which when\nselected will change the behaviour of the promotion in certain scenarios. The\nfirst is \nCannot be Combined,\n this field has a range of options which you can\nselect from: Blank, On Document or On Line.\n\n\n\n\nIf the option is left \nBlank,\n then it means that this promotion can be\napplied to a Sales document providing you qualify for it.\n\n\nIf you choose to set it to \nOn Document\n, it means that no other promotion can\nbe applied to a sales document where a promotion already exists, even if some of\nthe lines could qualify for another promotion.\n\n\nThe final option is \nOn Line,\n choosing this option means that if a line\nqualifies for a promotion another promotion cannot be applied to that same line,\neven if that line qualifies for a different promotion.\n\n\nThe second setup field is \nAllow Benefit Multiplication.\n\n\n\n\nSelecting this option determines whether the benefit of the promotion can be\nmultiplied or not. If this tick box has been selected then the benefits will\naccrue automatically, allowing the benefit of the promotion to be multiplied.\n\n\nFor example\n, with a BOGOF (Buy One Get One Free) promotion, if this option\nhas been ticked on the Promotion Card then it will allow multiplication, so that\nif the customer buys three of item X they get another three free.\n\n\nHowever, for some other promotions it may not be practical to have this\nmultiplication effect, \nfor example\n in a \"spend \u00a3100 on X and get \u00a320 off\"\npromotion the company may not want to give a \u00a340 discount if the customer spends\n\u00a3200.

After the code format has been specified I can go to Actions > Generate\nCodes and BC will create the number of codes automatically using the values in\nthe Number and Type fields, this will then create 20 random number series codes.\n\n\n\n\nThis promotion group is linked to a newly created promotion card, targeted to\nall customers and the qualification criteria is set so this is granted when the\nPromotion Code Type of Group is SALE25%.\n\n\nThe benefit is applicable to all items within Promotion Item Group 25SALES and\nconsists of giving a line discount of 25%.\n\n\n\n\nIn a similar way this can be modified to use an Item discount group rather than\na promotion item group, this can be changed from the Benefit Target Item Type\nfield:\n\n\n\n\nYou can also offer a flat discount Amount per line as opposed to a percentage if\nneeded. This can be done by changing the discount type to Line Discount Amount,\nthen specify the Amount you\u2019d like to deduct in the Discount Amount field.\n\n\nTo manage the items within a promotion item group you can use the search tool to\nfind the list view and then open each group code.\n\n\nFrom the Promotion Item group card, you can add items to the group using the Add\nItems function under Process, and filter the item list per various fields such\nas item category code to find the items you\u2019d like to add to the promotion\ngroup:\n\n\n\n\nItem discount groups are set on the individual item cards.\n\n\nOther benefit target types include \ncheapest\n and \nqualifying lines\n.\n\n\nYou can use a benefit target type of cheapest lines when you want the promotion\nto apply to the cheapest line on the sales document only, for example in cases\nwhere you would want to offer the cheapest line free or at a discounted amount.\nIn the example below, the promotion has been set up to give a line discount of\n100% for the cheapest line on the order to gift customers the cheapest line on\ntheir order. Similarly, this can be tweaked for offers such as buy one and get\none half price, to do this you\u2019d simply set the discount percentage at 50%.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you use target the benefit at qualifying lines only, you have the option to\neither set up discount amount/percentage for lines that meet the qualification\ncriteria of this promotion.\n\n\nFor example, for lines that qualify for the minimum amount or quantity you can\ndiscount the lines or offer these at a Set Price.\n\n\nBelow the promotion has been set up to give the item a set price of 100.00 when\na quantity of 5 are purchased within the Promotion Item Group CHAIR.\n\n\n\n\nIf you also selected to allow Benefit Multiplication so that the discount is\nmultiplied \u2013 not just given on the first 5 purchased.\n\n\nFor example, if the customer were to order a quantity of 10 these would be\noffered at a set price of \u00a3100, the benefit has been multiplied.",

To do this firstly create a promotion code group and create a list of sequential\ncodes which you can send out to all customers within customer price group B.\n(see Using Promotions codes on how to set these up).  These codes can then be used to obtain a 5% discount when the customer purchases\na minimum quantity of 5 items.

There is the option of either allocating the codes to a promotion group or\nhaving an individual promotion code which is set on the Promotion card.\nPromotion group codes are used in cases where you send out multiple promotional\ncodes to an X number of customers and want to contain the codes within a set\ngroup.  As per the setup below each promotional code can be used once only (Max no. of\nuses). After the code format has been specified I can go to Actions > Generate\nCodes and BC will create the number of codes automatically using the values in\nthe Number and Type fields, this will then create 20 random number series codes.   This promotion group is linked to a newly created promotion card, targeted to\nall customers and the qualification criteria is set so this is granted when the\nPromotion Code Type of Group is SALE25%.  The benefit is applicable to all items within Promotion Item Group 25SALES and\nconsists of giving a line discount of 25%.   In a similar way this can be modified to use an Item discount group rather than\na promotion item group, this can be changed from the Benefit Target Item Type\nfield:   You can also offer a flat discount Amount per line as opposed to a percentage if\nneeded. This can be done by changing the discount type to Line Discount Amount,\nthen specify the Amount you\u2019d like to deduct in the Discount Amount field.  To manage the items within a promotion item group you can use the search tool to\nfind the list view and then open each group code.  From the Promotion Item group card, you can add items to the group using the Add\nItems function under Process, and filter the item list per various fields such\nas item category code to find the items you\u2019d like to add to the promotion\ngroup:   Item discount groups are set on the individual item cards.  Other benefit target types include  cheapest  and  qualifying lines .  You can use a benefit target type of cheapest lines when you want the promotion\nto apply to the cheapest line on the sales document only, for example in cases\nwhere you would want to offer the cheapest line free or at a discounted amount.\nIn the example below, the promotion has been set up to give a line discount of\n100% for the cheapest line on the order to gift customers the cheapest line on\ntheir order. Similarly, this can be tweaked for offers such as buy one and get\none half price, to do this you\u2019d simply set the discount percentage at 50%.   When you use target the benefit at qualifying lines only, you have the option to\neither set up discount amount/percentage for lines that meet the qualification\ncriteria of this promotion.  For example, for lines that qualify for the minimum amount or quantity you can\ndiscount the lines or offer these at a Set Price.  Below the promotion has been set up to give the item a set price of 100.00 when\na quantity of 5 are purchased within the Promotion Item Group CHAIR.   If you also selected to allow Benefit Multiplication so that the discount is\nmultiplied \u2013 not just given on the first 5 purchased.  For example, if the customer were to order a quantity of 10 these would be\noffered at a set price of \u00a3100, the benefit has been multiplied.",
